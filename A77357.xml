            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>The firſt begins at the 15. verſe, <hi>John bare Witneſs of Him and cryed, ſaying, This was He of whom I ſpake.</hi> Wherein <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt doth prefer Jeſus Chriſt above himſelf; both
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:170112:11"/>in regard of His <hi>Perſon,</hi> and in regard of His <hi>Office;</hi> In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of His <hi>Perſon,</hi> as you reade in the latter end of the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi>, <hi>This was He of whom I ſpake, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for He was before me.</hi>

                  <p>In regard of His <hi>Office,</hi> at the 16, the 17, and 18. verſes: <hi>And of His Fulneſs have al we received, even Grace for Grace. For the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I confeſs there are Learned Interpreters, as <hi>Cyril,</hi> and <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> that do conceive the words of my Text, to be the words of <hi>John</hi> the Evangeliſt: the 15. verſe, having (as they ſay) relation unto <hi>Johns</hi> ſpeech in the latter end of the 14. verſe, <hi>Full of Grace and Truth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>Origen</hi> and others (unto whom I rather incline) think that they are the words of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are knit unto the former by the copulative <hi>And: And, of His fulneſs have all we received, Grace for Grace.</hi> He therefore that ſpake the <hi>words</hi> of the former verſe, in all likelyhood, ſpake theſe <hi>words:</hi> He that ſpake the <hi>words</hi> of the former verſe was <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt, and therfore theſe <hi>words</hi> being linked unto the former by the <hi>word, And,</hi> in all likelyhood are the words of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt.</p>
                  <p>The Words of themſelves fall into theſe Three Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions.</p>

                  <p>There is a great Controverſy upon the latter Clauſe, what ſhould be meant by thoſe Words, <hi>Even grace for grace:</hi> But becauſe the Determination thereof fals proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly within the compaſs of the Third Propoſition, and will have little influence upon the firſt, which I intend (God willing) to ſpeak unto at this time; therefore I paſs by
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:170112:11"/>that Controverſy, and come preſently unto the Firſt Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, which is this:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Doct.</hi> That there is a fulneſs of Grace in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Fulneſs is here attributed (you ſee) unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The word in the Original ſometimes is taken for <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi>

                     <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the fulneſs thereof:</hi> So here it is not taken; here it is too narrow: for there is not only <hi>Plenitudo abundantiae,</hi> but, <hi>Plenitudo redundantiae;</hi> not only a fulneſs of <hi>Abundance,</hi> but a fulneſſe of <hi>Redundancy;</hi> an over flowing of fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes the word is uſed for <hi>Fulfilling,</hi> and <hi>Perfecting</hi> of a thing: So Love is ſaid to be the <hi>Fulfilling</hi> of the Law. So it is not taken here, for though Chriſt be the end of the Law, yet notwithſtanding, the Fulneſs ſpoken here, is that which we do receive, and that is the Fulneſs of grace.</p>
                  <p>The word <hi>Firſtly,</hi> and <hi>Properly</hi> is given unto Veſſels, that are <hi>brim-ful</hi> of liquor; and ſo Metaphorically appli'd here unto our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is <hi>brim-ful</hi> of grace; in whom there is no emptyneſs, there is no evacuity. While I ſpeak of Jeſus Chriſt, I mean Chriſt as <hi>Mediator,</hi> as God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

The Fulneſs is here ſpoken of which we are ſaid to receive, of which we receive; we receive grace for grace; 'tis the Fulneſs therefore of grace that is in Chriſt, that I am now ſpeaking of.</p>
                  <p>Now the word <hi>Grace,</hi> ſometimes it is taken for the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Favour</hi> of God: <hi>We are ſaved by Grace:</hi> That is,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Firſt of all, Take grace for <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Mercy:</hi> and ſo there is, <hi>Plenitudo bonitatis,</hi> there is a Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of <hi>Love</hi> in Chriſt: The heart, and love of Chriſt now in Heaven, is the ſame toward poor ſinners, toward His Children, toward Beleevers, toward Men; as it was when He was upon the earth, when Chriſt was upon the earth.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, There was a fulneſs of <hi>Pardoning Love</hi> in Him: Then He would pardon men, before they did come for par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. <hi>Father,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, if you look into the Goſpel ye ſhall find, that when men were putting forth the higheſt acts of fin, He was putting forth the higheſt acts of His love. When Chriſt was ſuffering for <hi>Peter, Peter</hi> was denying Chriſt: <hi>Peter</hi> denying Chriſt, and Chriſt ſuffering for <hi>Peter.</hi> When He was upon the earth, He did not only pardon once, but He would pardon again and again: if men ſinned again, He would pardon again. The Diſciples ſlept, and Chriſt Pardon'd: They ſlept again, and Chriſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don'd again: they ſlept again, and Chriſt pardon'd again. Yea, and when He had pardon'd, He would not upbraid them with their former ſins, or with His own mercy: After His Reſurrection not a word to <hi>Peter,</hi> of all his deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, or of Chriſt mercy.

                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 5.3, 4.</note> for thoſe that were weak in grace. The firſt Sermon that He Preached, <hi>Bleſſed are the poor in ſpirit:</hi>
                     <pb n="5" facs="tcp:170112:12"/>and <hi>bleſſed are thoſe that mourn:</hi> He doth not ſay, bleſſed are thoſe that have aſſurance of the love of God: and bleſſed are thoſe that have the ſence of His Love in their hearts; but bleſſed are the Poor; and bleſſed are they that mourn: And when any poor doubting, trembling ſoul came unto Him, He would not caſt away their ſervice becauſe it was accompanied with <hi>infirmity:</hi> but He would rather paſſe by their infirmity, becauſe it was accompanied with ſome <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity:</hi> So the <hi>Woman</hi> that came behind Him: So <hi>Nicodemus.</hi> And when any poor ſoul could not come to Chriſt, could not come to Chriſt in Chriſts way; Chriſt would come down to him in his way: <hi>Thomas</hi> (ſaith He) Thou ſayeſt thou wilt not beleeve, unleſs thou thruſt thy hands into My ſide: <hi>Thomas,</hi> Thou wilt not honour Me by beleeving unleſs thou ſeeſt; <hi>Thomas,</hi> Thou wilt not come up to Me in My way: Well, I will come down to thee in thy way: Come, reach hither thy fingers, and thruſt thy hands into My ſide, and be not faithleſs, but beleeving. Oh! the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable condeſcention of the love of Jeſus Chriſt! Beloved! He is the ſame now in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>Again, When He was upon the Earth, He profeſſed that His heart, and His love, and affections was as much (if I ſay not more) unto one Saint,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.14. <hi>Matt.</hi> 12 47.50.</note> as unto all His kindred that are ſuch. <hi>Bleſſed are thoſe that keep Thy Commandements: Bebold,</hi> (ſay they) <hi>Thy Mother, and Thy Brother, and Siſter are without to ſpeak with Thee:</hi> Saies He, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall do the Will of My Father which is in Heaven, the ſame is My Brother, Siſter, and Mother.</hi> As if He ſhould ſay, You count My kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred happy, becauſe they are neer unto Me; but do you ſee one poor beleeving, trembling gracious ſoul? I tel you, the ſoul that keeps My Commandements, is as much unto Me as all My kindred that are ſuch, Here is love! And I ſay, the Lord Jeſus, His heart is the ſame ſtill in Heaven. And therefore you ſhall obſerve, that when He was riſen and came amongſt His Diſciples, the dore being ſhut; He comes into the room and He ſaies unto them,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke,</hi> 24.36.</note> 
                     <hi>Peace be unto you:</hi> Why Peace be unto you? (the ordinary way and
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:170112:13"/>manner of Salutation:) As if He would ſay thus much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them, That they ſhould find Him every way as courti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and as loving towards them now being riſen, as He was before He died.</p>
                  <p>And, my beloved, if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould not be as gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and as kind after death, as before; then His Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples ſhould be loſers by His death: But He profeſt to them before He died, that they ſhould not be loſers, but gai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners rather. When our Lord Chriſt was upon the earth, out of His love He died for us; He loved us, and died for us: His love then coſt Him much: Now that He is in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven He dies no more, He can love us at a cheaper rate. And ſhall we think, that when He was upon the earth, He would lay down His life for us; and now He is in Heaven He won't ſpeak a good word for us? Certainly, beloved, the Lord Jeſus is as full of love, and tender affection to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward <hi>His</hi> now He is in Heaven, as He was upon the earth. Take grace for <hi>Love,</hi> and ſo there is a fulneſs of grace in Jeſus Chriſt. That is the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Take grace for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and ſo there is, <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitudo ſanctitatis,</hi> a fulneſs of <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt. There are Three things in the old Teſtament that were very Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, The <hi>Law:</hi> The <hi>high Prieſt:</hi> And the <hi>Temple.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Ceremonial Law,</hi> though it was very holy; yet in regard of the Spiritual command of the Goſpel, and Chriſt; the Ceremonials of the Law, in the book of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.16</note> is called the <hi>Carnal Command.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>high Prieſt,</hi> though he had holineſs writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon his fore-head; yet therein he was but a type of Chriſt. And ſaith the Apoſtle in the book of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews: The high Prieſt then when he offered for others ſins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                     <hi>he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered firſt for his own ſins:</hi> But our high Prieſt not ſo.</p>
                  <p>And as for the <hi>Temple,</hi> it was indeed very holy, the <hi>Jews</hi> reſted much thereupon: And therefore they cryed thrice,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jer.</hi> 7.4</note> 
                     <hi>The Temple, the Temple, the Temple of the Lord:</hi> But now if you look into the 6. <hi>Chap. of Eſay,</hi> you ſhal find that our Lord Chriſt is there upon the <hi>Temple;</hi> and whereas
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:170112:13"/>they cryed Three times for the <hi>Temple, The Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord:</hi> Three times this is ecchoed concerning Chriſt, <hi>Holy, holy, holy.</hi> (At the firſt verſe) <hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a throne, high and lifted up, and His Train filled the Temple;</hi> His Train fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the <hi>Temple. Above it ſtood the Seraphims: each had ſix wings, with twain he covered his face, with twain he covered his feet, and with twain he did fly, and one cryed unto another, and ſaid, Holy, holy, holy.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: you that are the <hi>Jewes,</hi> you cry out of <hi>the Temple; The Temple, the Temple, the Temple:</hi> But here's holineſs, here's one that is holy, <hi>Holy, holy, holy.</hi> That this is to be underſtood of Chriſt, you may ſee plainly, by comparing it with the 4. Chapter of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> at the 2. verſe: <hi>Immediately I was in the Spirit: and behold, a Throne was ſet in Heaven, and one ſate on the Throne.</hi> (as it is ſaid in <hi>Eſay</hi>) <hi>one ſate on the Throne. And he that ſate was to look upon as a Jaſper, and a Sardine ſtone: And there was a rain-bow round about the Throne: And round a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Throne were four and twenty Seats, and there were four and twenty Elders, and four living creatures:</hi> (The diſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Goſpel-Church) <hi>And</hi> (ſaith he at the 8. verſe:) <hi>The four beaſts had each of them ſix wings about him, and they were full of eyes within, and they reſt not day and night, ſaying, Holy, holy, holy.</hi> (Mark) the very ſame expreſſion that you have there in <hi>Eſay:</hi> he doth not ſay thus, <hi>Righteous, righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, righteous; Juſt, juſt, juſt:</hi> But <hi>Holy, holy, holy.</hi> Is there not then a fulneſs of <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>I'le give you but Two Demonſtrations of it.</p>
                  <p>If there were not a fulneſs of <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, how is it poſſible that God and man could be brought ſo neer together, that were ſo far aſunder? Every man naturally is full of ſin: You ſay of the Begger, He is full of vermine, why? becauſe he goes to this door, to that door, and to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother door, and he ſcatters his vermine where ever he comes, and the man knows it not: Surely therefore, the man is full of vermine.</p>
                  <p>And ſo a man naturally, dropping, and ſcattering his ſins
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170112:14"/>and not knowing of it, it argues he is ful of ſin. God, he is full of Holineſs: whoſe eyes cannot endure to behold ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity: yet when men are converted and drawn to God, they are brought neer unto him: they are the apple of His eye: their names are written in the palme of his hand. That is, (ſaies <hi>Luther</hi>) the hand is an inſtrument of work; and when the names of the Saints are ſaid to be written in the palme of Gods hand, it notes thus much (ſaies he) That God in all his works hath an eye to his Children; God in all the works of his hands hath an eye to his Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They are the friends of God, and God is their friend: When a man is my friend, not only his <hi>Purſe</hi> is my friend, or his <hi>Eſtate</hi> is my friend, or his <hi>Tongue</hi> is my friend, or his <hi>Hand</hi> is my friend; but his <hi>Sword</hi> is my friend: So when God is a friend to any, not only his <hi>Mercy</hi> is his friend, but the <hi>Sword</hi> of God is his friend, the very <hi>Wrath</hi> of God is a friend to his Children: Such a great friendſhip there is between God and his people, ſo neer they are brought to one another. Well, but how are they brought thus neer? They are brought neer by Jeſus Chriſt: in whom we have a Manuduction, a leading by the hand (ſaies the Apoſtle) as the word carries it) unto God the Father. But now, could men ſo full of ſin, and God ſo full of Grace, and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs be brought ſo neer together by Jeſus Chriſt, if there were not an infinit fulneſſe of <hi>Holineſs</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Again, If there were not this fulneſſe of Holineſſe in Chriſt, how ſhould he be anointed with the oyl of glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe above his fellowes? The Saints themſelves are ſaid to be full of grace.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.23.</note> The Church called, <hi>The fulneſſe of Chriſt that filleth all in all: Stephen, Mary,</hi> others: full of the holy Ghoſt: Surely therefore, if ſo much of the oyntment run down upon Chriſts Members, there muſt be a great anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon Chriſt himſelf: Surely, there muſt be an infinit holineſſe in Chriſt, that muſt ſerve us all: And of his ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe we have <hi>All</hi> received, we have <hi>All</hi> received.</p>

                  <p>Yes, For though the Saints be full of grace, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; yet their fulneſſe is but a fulneſſe of <hi>Sufficiency,</hi> (Mark) whereby they are made able to this, or that work whereunto they are appointed: But the fulneſſe of Chriſt, is a fulneſſe of <hi>Efficiency,</hi> that filleth all in all. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore 'tis ſaid in this Chapter, <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh</hi> 1.17</note>

                  <p>The fulneſſe that is in the Saints, is but a <hi>Particular</hi> fulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The fulneſſe that is in CHRIST, is an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall</hi> fulneſſe. Therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, <hi>It pleaſed the Father,</hi>

                     <hi>that in him ſhould all fulneſs dwel.</hi> All fulneſſe.</p>
                  <p>The fulneſſe that is in the Saints, is ſuch a fulneſſe as does ebbe and flow; as the Haven is ſaid to be full of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, yet ſometimes 'tis empty: but there is a <hi>dwelling</hi> ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in the Sea: So there is a <hi>dwelling</hi> fulneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt: and therefore ſaies the Apoſtle, It pleaſed the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that in Him ſhould all fulneſſe <hi>dwel:</hi> Oh! 'tis a <hi>dwelling</hi> fulneſſe that is in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Our Righteouſneſſe as we are diſtinct, or abſtracted from Chriſt, 'tis but a fading Righteouſneſſe: as the morning dew. <hi>Our righteouſneſs</hi> (ſaies <hi>Hoſea</hi>) <hi>is as the morning dew,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 6.4.</note> in regard of it's fading: But the holineſs, and righteouſneſs of Chriſt, in the 110. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> is called, <hi>The dew of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning:</hi> not in regard of it's fading nature, but in regard of it's much-neſs. in regard of it's multitude, becauſe it makes al dewy.

                  <p>Would you have a proof of His <hi>Prophetical</hi> fulneſs? look into this Chapter where the Text lies, and it's ſaid, at the next verſe, the 17. verſe; <hi>The Law was given by</hi> Moſes <hi>but grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt: No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son, which is in the bosome of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, He hath declared Him.</hi> Ye all count <hi>Moſes</hi> a great Prophet; ſo he was: But Jeſus Chriſt was above him, in two, or three things here.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Moſes</hi> gave the Law: But grace came by Jeſus Chriſt grace and truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>Would you have a proof of Chriſts fulneſs of <hi>Excellency</hi> in general?

What is there in all the world that is the deſire of <hi>all</hi> nations but Jeſus Chriſt? Some Nations, ſome Kingdoms, (as the Weſt-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies) they are full of <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver,</hi> but they want <hi>Clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing;</hi> and therefore they deſire <hi>Cloth.</hi> Other Kingdoms now, (as theſe of England, and the like) they have much <hi>Cloathing,</hi> and <hi>Cloath;</hi> but they want <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> and they deſire that: Some Nations they abound with <hi>Spices,</hi> and with <hi>Wines;</hi> but they want <hi>Corn:</hi> and they deſire that. Some Nations again, they have much <hi>Corn,</hi> I but they have no <hi>Wine,</hi> no <hi>Spices;</hi> and they deſire that. Oh! but our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, He is the deſire of <hi>All</hi> Nations, the deſire of <hi>All</hi> Nations. What woman, never ſo beautiful that the whole world was in love with?

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170112:16"/>then there is a fulneſs of excellency in Jeſus Chriſt: But our Lord Jeſus is the deſire of all Nations, having the prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minency in all the world; ſurely therefore, there is a ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of excellency in Jeſus Chriſt, a fulneſs of excellency, a fulneſs of Holineſs,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8.</note> a fulneſs of Love: No wonder then that <hi>Paul</hi> ſaies, <hi>I deſire to know nothing, but Jeſus Chriſt, and Him Crucified:</hi> No wonder that He ſaid, <hi>I count all things but dung, and droſs,</hi> in compariſon of the knowledge of Jeſus Chriſt Certainly, ſurely, there is a fulneſs of grace in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

                  <p>I have read of the Senate of <hi>Athens,</hi> that once upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, they were conſtrained to ſit in the open fields: and being there ſet in the open fields; a poor chaſed bird, a ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, or the like; chaſed by the birds of prey; came flying to the boſom of one of the Senators, for reſcue from the birds of prey: The Senator being of a churliſh diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, he takes the poor, little, chaſed bird, and throws it from him, upon the ground, and ſo kil'd the bird: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Senate</hi> made an Order, that he ſhould die himſelf:
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170112:17"/>they would not have a man ſo churliſh to be one of the Senators. And do you think, that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, when you come as a poor, chaſed bird for ſhelter into His boſom: Do you think that the Lord Chriſt wil throw you away? No, no. as He is full of glory, and excellency; ſo He is full of love, and bounty: Whatever therefore thou haſt bin (man or woman) whatever you have been: though you have been never ſo vile, Come unto Jeſus Chriſt, come unto Jeſus Chriſt. Oh! me thinks this Doctrine that I have now preached unto you, is a ſolemn, and a great invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to every ſoul for to come unto Jeſus Chriſt: &amp; therefore come now unto Him, Come unto Chriſt, Come unto Chriſt: Come Drunkard, Come Swearer, Come Liar, Come Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon; Oh! Come, come: You that never taſted of Chriſts ſweetneſs, you that never yet pertak't of Chriſts fulneſſe; Come now; Come for there is a fulneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt. That's the firſt thing.</p>
                  <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2</hi> Duty.</note> If there be ſuch a fulneſſe in Chriſt; <hi>Then let us all truſt unto Him, build upon him:</hi> And you that are the Servants, and People of God, truſt, and truſt perfectly: There is no grace would ſtand us in more ſtead in theſe evil times. Beloved! ye al ſee into what ſad times we are now fallen: There is no grace (I ſay) wil ſtand us in more ſtead, or more able to turn away the evil that is now upon us, then faith is. <hi>Luther</hi> hath a notable ſtory to this purpoſe: There was (ſaith he) a deadly conteſt, between a great <hi>Biſhop,</hi> and a <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Saxonie:</hi> The <hi>Duke</hi> of Saxonie pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pares for War againſt him: but before he would come up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, he ſends a Spy to obſerve what the Biſhop was a doing: The Spy went: and being returned again; Come (ſaies the Duke) what is the Biſhop a doing? Sir (ſaies he) he is idle, and ſecure, you may fall upon him, and deſtroy him when you wil: I (ſaies he) but what ſaies the Biſhop? Sir, he ſaies thus: I will feed my flock, I will viſit the ſick, I will preach the Goſpel; and as for the War, I will <hi>Toti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us belli molem Deo committere,</hi> I wil commit the whol weight and bulk of this War to God Himſelf who fighteth for me.
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170112:17"/>I (ſaies the Duke) did the Biſhop ſay ſo? <hi>Bellum ei infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat Diabolus, non ego,</hi> then (ſaies he) Let the Devil take up Arms againſt him if he will, for I will not. Thus, thus faith, faith turns away the Sword, faith turns away War. And my beloved, there is no ſuch way, either to beget, or increaſe faith, as the ſight, and conſideration of the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Thoſe that know Thy Name,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 9.10. <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 36.7.</note> (ſaith the <hi>Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt) they will truſt unto Thee: How excellent is Thy Name, O Lord; therefore do the children of men put their truſt in Thee.</hi> Beloved! ye have heard of Chriſts Name, His Name is ful of ſweetneſſe: Oh! therefore, you servants, and People of God, that have gon fearing, and trembling up and down, drooping under many fears, without aſſurance of Gods love in Chriſt; if there be ſuch a fulneſſe in Chriſt, then truſt unto Him: yea, truſt, and truſt perfectly to Him. If Satan come and tempt you, and ſaies thus unto you; Thou art a poor unworthy creatrue; and doſt thou think to have mercy? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> True Satan, I am ſo indeed, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy. but there is a fulneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt, and I will truſt in Him. Does Satan tempt thee, and ſay unto thee; Thou art a poor guilty creature, and doſt thou think to find mercy? <hi>Anſwer,</hi> True Satan, I confeſſe I am, I have committed ſuch and ſuch ſins; but there is a fulneſſe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and I will truſt in him: Say, ſay Satan what thou wilt againſt me, I ſubſcribe unto it: I am poor, I am empty, I am unworthy, I am guilty: but Chriſt is Full, Chriſt is Full; there is Fulneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt, I will truſt unto Him. Oh! you Servants of the Lord, Live much by Faith: there is a Fulneſſe in Chriſt, truſt unto it. And that's the ſecond.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, If there be ſuch a fulneſs in Chriſt:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Duty.</note> 
                     <hi>Then 'tis our duty to draw forth this fulneſs:</hi> Let all men draw forth this fulneſs. That is done theſe Three waies:</p>
                  <p>Firſt by a ſerious, frequent, ſolemn conſideration, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> and eyeing of Chriſts fulneſs.<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> For <hi>beholding as in a glaſs</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>we are changed from glory to glory:</hi> The behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of Chriſts glory, changes us into glory.</p>
                  <pb n="16" facs="tcp:170112:18"/>
                  <p>'Tis drawn forth alſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> by our reſting upon it in a time of Temptation. 'Tis here in regard of Chriſts fulneſs, as in regard of Gods mercy, or promiſe: (pray mark it) My very reſting upon Gods promiſe in the time of a Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, does make it mine: my very reſting upon His mercy in a time of Temptation, does make His mercy mine: and my reſting alſo, or your reſting upon the fulneſs of Chriſt in the time of a Temptation, does make it yours.</p>
                  <p>'Tis drawn forth alſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> by <hi>giving forth:</hi> As now, the Conduit, or Ciſtern receives more water into it, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out the water which it hath. Poſſibly, there may be much water in the Conduit, or much water in the Ciſtern; and the fountain may be willing to furniſh it with more, but 'tis full already; therefore now, turn the cock, and let that run out which it hath received already, and it draws more into the Ciſtern: So here, beloved, our very ſpending for Chriſt receives from Chriſt: the way to draw out His fulneſs, is to lay out His fulneſs; as you do receive from Him, ſo to comunicate to other folk: this draws it out. Well then, A fulneſs ye have heard there is in Chriſt. This fulneſs is to be drawn out; ye hear alſo, how it is, or may be drawn out. Enter therefore into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and when you are all alone; ſeriouſly, frequently, think much of this Fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: and in the time of your Temptation, then reſt upon it. And as it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth Jeſus Chriſt to give out any of His Fulneſs unto you, ſo let it run out again upon other folk. And this is the third thing.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>4</hi> Duty.</note> If there be ſuch a fulneſs of grace in Chriſt: <hi>Then let us all labour to be like unto Him;</hi> full of grace as Chriſt, full of meekneſs, full of humility, full of <hi>Love e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially;</hi> for there is a fulneſs of love in Chriſt. And yet, alas! when ever was there leſſe love, and more ſtrife then now? when ever leſſe love among Profeſſors? when ever more ſtrife then now? Give me leave a little: Beloved in the Lord! you ſee, and know what great diviſions there are among us, great ſtrifes. All ſtrife and envy ariſes from
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170112:18"/>an apprehenſion of ſcantineſs, and narrowneſs in the thing deſired. Now then, that which we do ſtrive for; either it is more of the <hi>World:</hi> Or more of <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If it be more of the <hi>World</hi> that we ſirive for; who ſhall be moſt <hi>Rich,</hi> who ſhall have moſt <hi>Honor:</hi> if it be more of the world that we ſtrive for: Why? Oh! why ſhould we ſtrive for that which may make us worſer, but cannot make us better? why ſhould we ſtrive for that, when as the very ſtriving for it, will deprive us of it? If it be more of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that we ſtrive for: (mark) if it be more of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and more of Him that we ſtrive for; There is enough in Him, there is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough in Jeſus Chriſt for to ſerve us al. If two, or three, or ſix, or twenty men be a thirſt; and they go to drink out of a <hi>Bottle:</hi> while one is drinking the other envies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he thinks there will not be enough for him too: But if now, five, ſix, twenty, a hundred be a thirſt; and go to the <hi>River:</hi> while one is drinking the other envies not: Why? becauſe there is enough to ſerve them all. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! if it be more of <hi>Chriſt</hi> that we ſtrive for, if it be more of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> that we ſtrive for; there is a fulneſs in Him, there is enough in Chriſt; there is enough in Jeſus Chriſt (ye have heard) to ſerve all our turns. Oh! therefore, that there may be no more ſtriving, no more enuy, no more contention, no more diviſion, labor, let us all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor to be more and more like unto Jeſus Chriſt: He was full of grace, eſpecially He was full of love, let us labor to to be like unto Him.</p>
                  <p>In the fift, and laſt place: The fift Duty.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>5</hi> Duty</note> If there be ſuch a fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Then take heed how we do any thing that may rob Chriſt of the glory of His fulneſs:</hi> Let all men take heed how they do any thing that may rob Jeſus Chriſt of the glory of His fulneſs. As now, Suppoſe that I think, and am perſwaded, that Jeſus Chriſt hath not given a ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient rule, hath not laid down a perfect a ſufficient rule in the Word, for the Ordering, and for the Governing of the Churches: and therefore I will <hi>eek</hi> out what He hath done with my own prudence: This robs Him of the glory
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170112:19"/>of His <hi>Prophetical</hi> fulneſs. Or, ſuppoſe I think my ſins are ſo great, they can never be pardoned, ſo great, there is no hope for mercy: This robs Him of the glory of His <hi>Prieſtly</hi> fulneſs. Or, ſuppoſe that I ſtint, and limit Chriſt unto this, or that particular means of delivering of the Church; I know that God is able to deliver <hi>England,</hi> and to deliver the <hi>Church;</hi> but if He do not take this way, if He do not take this courſe, if this means fail, then we are all undone, then all, all is loſt if this means take not: This is to rob Chriſt of the glory of His <hi>Kingly</hi> fulneſs; to ſtint Him to one means; to tie Him, and limit Him to one means. Or, ſuppoſe that I ſet my heart upon any Creature fulneſs; and ſay as the whore ſaid in the 7 of the <hi>Proverbs, Come, and let us take our fill of love:</hi> Come friends, come company, let us go unto ſuch a Tavern, or ſuch a place, where we may be fully merry: Come, O my ſoul, take thy contentment in creature fulneſs, there is enough there: This robs Chriſt of the glory of all His fulneſs. To carry away the cuſtom of my thoughts unto another Shop from Chriſt, argues that there is not enough in Chriſt alone. Then, beloved! to conclude all. Are there any here; (as I fear there may be too many) that have thus robbed Jeſus Chriſt of the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of His fulneſs? I beſeech you, in the Name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, whoſe fulneſs I have bin now preaching to you; I beſeech you, in the fear of God, go into your Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, and be alone awhile, and fall down before the Lord, and ſay thus unto Him, or to this purpoſe:</p>
                  <p>Oh! Lord, I confeſs it hath bin ſo w<hi rend="sup">th</hi> me: I have thought that there hath not bin a ſufficient rule for the Government of the Churches; and herein I have wronged Chriſt in His <hi>Prophetical</hi> fulneſs, and the Lord pardon this unto me.</p>
                  <p>Lord! I confeſs alſo, I haue ſaid, many times, that my fins are ſo great, that there is no hope for mercy, that there is no hope for pardon; herein I have wronged the <hi>Prieſtly</hi> fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt: now the Lord pardon this unto me,</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, Lord, I have ſtinted thee, and I have limitted
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170112:19"/>thee, and I have ſaid, many times, in my haſt; if this means fail, then <hi>England</hi> is undone, the <hi>Church</hi> undone; thus I have limitted thee, Lord: Oh! herein I have wrong'd thee, and robbed Chriſt in His <hi>Kingly</hi> fulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Yea, Lord, I do acknowledge, and I do confeſs, I have gone to creature-comforts, and my heart hath taken a content and complacency, as if there were enough there; but now I ſee there is a fulneſs in Jeſus Chriſt: the Lord pardon me, that ever I let out my heart upon any creature-comfort, upon any thing but Jeſus Chriſt. You that have bin guilty; fall down, and humble your ſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord and conſider that there is a fulneſs in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and labor to draw out this fulneſs from Him. Which that you may ſo do, think on all theſe things, and the Lord bleſſe them to you.</p>

                     <hi>He bears up all with the Word of His Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer:</hi> yet notwithſtanding, all the Creatures in Heaven or Earth, cannot be meant here, by this, <hi>All Wee:</hi> for all the creatures in Heaven and Earth, do not receive Grace: they may be ſaid to receive of the Fulneſſe of Chriſt; but not Grace for Grace. <hi>But</hi> (at the 12. verſe, 'tis ſaid) <hi>as many as received Him, to them gave He power to become the Sons of God, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen to them that beleeve in his Name.</hi> Now in Scripture phraſe, thoſe are ſaid to receive Chriſt Himſelf, that do receive His Grace: and thoſe that receive His Grace, receive Chriſt Himſelf.

                  <p>And then the Obſervation, or Doctrine lies plain before us, which is this:</p>
                  <p>

                  <pb n="21" facs="tcp:170112:20"/>
                  <p>It falls a ſunder into Two parts, Thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, That there is a communication of the Fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt unto all Beleevers.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That whatſoever Grace or Holineſs the Saints have from Chriſt, they have it in a way of receiving.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall only ſpeak unto the former at this time:</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>There is a communication of the Fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt unto all Beleevers. Of His Fulneſs all we receive.</hi> (mark) There is a communication of the Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers.</p>
                  <p>He is the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> which the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. Chapter, and the 45. verſe, <hi>The firſt man</hi> Adam <hi>was made a living ſoul, and the laſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> The whole world is divided into Two great Houſes: As once in this Kingdom, There was the Houſe of <hi>York:</hi> And the Houſe of <hi>Lancaſter.</hi> So now, the whole world is divided into Two great Houſes: The Houſe of the <hi>Firſt</hi> Adam: And the Houſe of the <hi>Second</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam. The firſt man <hi>Adam</hi> was made a living ſoul, and the laſt <hi>Adam</hi> was made a quickning Spirit: that is, look as the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> did communicate life unto all his ſeed: So the ſecond <hi>Adam</hi> does communicate Spiritual life, and grace unto all his people. As by the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> ſin, and ſorrow, and death came into the world; and ſo upon all man-kind: So by the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> grace, and life, and eternal life unto all Beleevers. There is a dealing out, a giving out of the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt unto all Beleevers. This will appear.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, by the Union that there is between Chriſt,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>1</hi> Reaſon</note> and a Beleever: there is a glorious, a bleſſed, an incompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable union between Chriſt, and every Beleever, though he be never ſo weak, though he be never ſo poor. There is a union between the <hi>Root,</hi> and the <hi>Branches;</hi> and by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of that union, the Root ſends forth life, and ſtrength into all the Branches: but yet notwithſtanding, the Root is not in the Branches; nor the Branches in the Root, mutually. There is a union between the <hi>Head,</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170112:21"/>the <hi>Members;</hi> and by vertue of that union, the Head hath an influence upon all the Members: but yet the Head is not in the Members; nor the Members in the Head. But now, there is a union between <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>Beleevers:</hi> and Chriſt is in them; and they are in Chriſt: We in Chriſt, and Chriſt in us. There is a glorious, and bleſſed union between them. Now union is the cauſe of communion, or communication: bread is united unto a mans body by eating of it; and ſo by vertue of the union, ſtrength is deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into all the parts, into all the members; and the nea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, and cloſer unto, this union is, the more full is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication. Now though the union between Chriſt, and a Beleever, be ſet out in Scripture phraſe, under ſuch Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphors as theſe: The <hi>Root,</hi> and the <hi>Branches:</hi> The <hi>Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band,</hi> and the <hi>Wife:</hi> And the <hi>Head,</hi> and <hi>Members;</hi> yet none of all theſe are able to reach it, not in all reſpects: 'tis a glorious, and 'tis a bleſſed, and incomparable union. And therefore, there muſt needs be a comunication of the fulneſs of Chriſt to every Beleever.</p>

                  <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> There is an infinite treaſury of Grace, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Jeſus Chriſt; whereby He is able to ſupply, and ſuccour all thoſe that are tempted. If a man hath had a ſtraight ſhoe upon his foot, or a ſtraight garment; he knows where it pinches, and accordingly he is able to get it mended. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, He hath put on our fleſh, and knows where it pinches: He hath bin cloa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed with our fleſh, and He knows every place where it pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; and accordingly He is able to ſuccour. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>He was in al things tempted like unto us,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.18.</note> 
                     <hi>that He might be able to ſuccour thoſe that are tempted.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt is not only, the <hi>Lord-Treaſurer</hi> of all our comforts; but the <hi>Lord Keeper</hi> of al our graces. The neerer any thing comes unto the Fountain of excellency, the more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent it is: The Sun is the fountain of light: and the nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170112:21"/>any thing comes to the Sun, the more light it hath. Fire is the fountain of warmth, and heat; and the neerer any thing comes unto the fire, the more warm it is. Why, The <hi>Deitie</hi> is the Fountain of all Holineſs; and Jeſus Chriſt is ſo neer unto it, as Mediator; that the Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>In Him the fulneſs of the God Head dwells.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 2.9.</note> And ſurely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, there muſt needs be an infinite treaſury of Grace, and Holineſſe in Him.</p>
                  <p>The Saints (you know) of the <hi>Old-Teſtament,</hi> they were very Holy; <hi>Abraham,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph,</hi> and <hi>Moſes,</hi> and <hi>Samuel,</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomon;</hi> they were full of Grace, and Holineſſe: and yet theſe were but types of Chriſt, they were but ſhadows of Chriſt. Now the type and the ſhadow does fall infinitly ſhort of the thing typi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and of the ſubſtance: And therefore, if there were ſo much Grace, and Holineſſe in things that were but a ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of Chriſt; if there was ſo much Wiſdome, and Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe in others of them that were but the type: Oh! what an infinit treaſury of Grace, and Holineſſe muſt there be in Chriſt Himſelf. This is the firſt Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, As there is an infinit treaſury of Grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> and Holineſſe in Jeſus Chriſt: So whatever Grace, and holineſs Chriſt as Mediator hath received by God the Father; He hath not received it for Himſelf, but for others: Pray mark it, Whatſoever Grace, and Holines is in Jeſus Chriſt as Mediator, (I do not ſpeak of Him as God, but as Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor) He hath not received it for Himſelfe, but for others. Jeſus Chriſt was not Baptized for Himſelf, but for finners, ſtood in the place of ſinners when He was Baptized. Jeſus Chriſt died not for Himſelf, but for us. When Chriſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended up to Heaven, He went not for Himſelf only, but ſaith He, <hi>I go to prepare a place for you.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jo.</hi> 14.2. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.8</note> And ſo when Chriſt received gifts; (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>He received gifts for men;</hi> not for Himſelfe, but for others: He received gifts for men. The woman hath milk in her breaſts, but not for her ſelfe but for her child. The Sun hath abundance of light in his body, 'tis not for himſelf, but for the world. And ſo
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170112:22"/>Jeſus Chriſt, He hath received abundance of grace, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſſe; but 'tis not for Himſelf but for others. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray mark what He ſaies, in <hi>John,</hi> 17.19. <hi>And for their ſakes I ſanctifie My ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the Truth.</hi> He does not ſay, for My own ſake do I ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie My ſelf, but for their ſakes: <hi>For their ſakes I ſanctifie my ſelf, that they alſo might be ſanctified through the Truth.</hi> There are certain <hi>Official</hi> parts in the body (you know) that ſtand as Officers unto all the reſt. The <hi>ſtomack</hi> hath a great deal of meat in it, but it hath not that meat for it ſelf but that it may communicate to all the members. The <hi>liver</hi> hath a great deal of blood in it but the liver hath not the blood in it for it ſelf, but that it may communicate it unto all the parts. And the <hi>head,</hi> it hath all the fences ſeated in it, it hath many ſpirits: but not for it ſelf, but for the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. So Jeſus Chriſt, who is the Head of the Church: whatſoever Grace, and Holineſſe, as Mediator, He hath received; He hath not received for Himſelfe, but for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</p>
                  <p>This may make the Saints, and People of God to come with boldneſſe to the Throne of Grace: Hath Chriſt received for others, &amp; not for Himſelf; Then why not for me? Lord, why not for me? Now you ſhal ſee that further proved in the 61. <hi>Chap. of Eſay. the</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. <hi>verſes. The Spirit of the Lord God is on me, becauſe the Lord hath anointed me to preach good tydings unto the meek; He hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, and the open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the priſon to them that are bound. To proclaim the accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table yeer of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort all that mourn:</hi> They are the words of Chriſt, ſpoken in the Perſon of Chriſt: as if he had ſaid thus: There are a generation of men in the world, that are taken captive by their ſins; and lie bound in chains, and irons by Satan: and they are broken, and bowed down greatly under the burden of them: Now God the Father, He hath deſign'd me, to go open the priſon dores to theſe poor captives: and becauſe God the Father hath deſign'd me to it; therefore
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:170112:22"/>the Spirit of the Lord is <hi>upon</hi> me, (not in me) therefore the Spirit of the Lord is <hi>upon</hi> me, becauſe the Lord hath anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me to preach good tydings unto the meek. So that you ſee now, that anointing that falls upon the head of Chriſt, it falls not upon Him for Himſelf, barely, but that it may run down upon all His members. That is a ſecond Propoſition.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, As there is an infinite treaſury of grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and holineſs in Chriſt: which He hath not received for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but for others: So (in the third place,) there is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite propenſion, and willingneſs in Jeſus Chriſt to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate this grace unto the children of men. Pray mark it: There is an infinit propenſion, and willingneſſe in Jeſus Chriſt; to communicate, and give out his grace unto the children of men.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2.</note> 
                     <hi>He is faithful</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>in all His houſe as</hi> Moſes <hi>was.</hi> Now if Jeſus Chriſt ſhould receive gifts for men, for others; and then run away with all, and not be willing to give them out; He could not be faithful: but faithful He is. Look I pray for this in the 16. Pſal. 2 v. <hi>Thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord, my goodneſs not for thee: but for the Saints that are in the earth, and for the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent in whom are all my delight.</hi> You reade the words thus: Thou haſt ſaid unto the Lord, Thou art my Lord; my goodneſſe extendeth not to thee. But in the Hebrew, the word <hi>extendeth</hi> is not. Thou art my Lord: my goodneſſe not for thee: but for the Saints that are in the earth. That theſe words are ſpoken of Chriſt. Pray reade the Four laſt verſes; <hi>I have ſet the Lord alwayes before me:</hi> (at the 8. ver.) <hi>becauſe He is at my right hand, I ſhall not be moved. Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoyceth: my fleſh alſo ſhall reſt in hope. For thou wilt not leave my ſoul in Hell; neither wilt thou ſuffer thy holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> Now compare theſe words with what the Apoſtle ſaies in <hi>Acts,</hi> 2.25. David <hi>ſpeaketh concerning him,</hi> (mark) <hi>For I foreſaw the Lord alwayes before my face, he is on my right hand, I ſhall not be moved: Therefore did my heart rejoyce, and my tongue was glad: Moreover alſo, my fleſh ſhall reſt in hope: Becauſe thou will not leave my ſoul in hell,</hi>
                     <pb n="26" facs="tcp:170112:23"/>(the ſame viorde) <hi>neither wilt thou ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> Mark what is ſaid then, at the 29. ver. the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle proves, That theſe words of the Pſalm, muſt needs be underſtood of Chriſt, and not of <hi>David. Men and brethren,</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>let me freily ſpeak unto you of the Patriarch</hi> David, <hi>that he is both dead and buried, and his Sepulcher is with us unto this day.</hi> Therefore (ſaies he) theſe words cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of <hi>David,</hi> but muſt be underſtood of Chriſt. Now then, this Pſalm being thus to be underſtood of Chriſt, ſaies Chriſt, <hi>Lord, Thomi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>t my Lord: my goodneſs is not for thee: but for the Saints that are in the earth, and for the excellent in whom is all my delight.</hi> They are my delight, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore what goodneſſe I have from thee, I am willing to give it out again unto them, becauſe al my delight is in them. Do you not think, that a man is willing to eat his meat when he is a hungry I ray look into the 4. chaptes of <hi>John,</hi> and you ſhall ſee what was Chriſts meat (verſe the 34.) <hi>Jeſus faith unto them, My meat is to do the will of Him that ſent Me, and to finiſh His Work.</hi> My meat is to do the will of Him that ſent Me: What is that? Finiſh His Work: What is that? You reade before in the, 61 <hi>Eſay, That the Spirit of the Lord was upon Him: and God the Father had anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Him to open the priſon door.</hi> Now therefore (ſaith He) look how willing a man is to eat his meat when he is a hungry: So willing am I to releeve poor ſinners, to open the priſon dore to poor captive ſouls. Tender hearted Mothers, are you willing to give your Children ſuck? to have your breaſts drawn? Yes: Why ſo? Truly, not only becauſe of my child, but the truth is, unleſs my breaſts be drawn 'tis a pain to me: not only for my child there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but for my own eaſe alſo, you will ſay. Why, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, the Humanity of Jeſus Chriſt, is (as I may ſo ſpeak) the breaſts of the Deity; by which we ſuck out all the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, and grace which we have: and if Jeſus Chriſts breaſts be not drawn, He counts it a pain to Him. And therefore He complains ſo in the Goſpel:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.11.</note> 
                     <hi>I came unto mine own, and mine own received me not;</hi> They will not draw My
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170112:23"/>breaſts; He counts it a pain to Him. Tell me, are you willing to receive grace? Yes: If you be willing to receive grace, Jeſus Chriſt is willing to give it: for you cannot be willing, if He were not willing firſt, your willingneſs does come from His. But I pray, what grace are you wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to have Oh! ſaies one, I am a poor ignorant crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: I would fain, I would fain have more knowledge. Oh! ſaies one, I am one of great Paſſions, and of a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered life; and, Oh! that I had my life better ordered. Oh! ſaies another, I am a poor guilty ſoul; and I would have pardon, I would have pardoning grace. Now I'le appeal to you: Whether do you not think, that an honeſt man is willing to do the work of his office? Can a man be an honeſt man, and not be willing to do the work of his office? This is the <hi>Office</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt. He is a Prophet, and therefore He muſt be willing to teach you you that complain that you are ignorant. This is the <hi>Office</hi> of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt to be a King; and therefore He is willing to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect you; and to order you: You that complain of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and diſorder.</p>
                  <p>This is the <hi>Office</hi> of Chriſt to be a Prieſt, and therfore He is willing to ſatisfie for you: and indeed, if Jeſus Chriſt were not willing to give out His grace unto the children of men, He would never lay it upon ſuch conditions as He does. When a man is unwilling to do a thing for another, He will put it upon hard conditions: As <hi>Saul,</hi> being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to give his Daughter to <hi>David,</hi> He put it upon hard conditions. But now, what does Jeſus Chriſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire? What does the Lord Jeſus Chriſt require, for the Communication of His grace? But only this, that you do receive it: Mark, only this, that we do receive it; a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition indeed, that is no condition: I ſay, a condition that is no condition, becauſe he promiſes ſtrength to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive alſo. Oh! my beloved: Why ſhould we cumber the way to Heaven with Preparations, and Qualifications, and Precedaneous conditions? There are no In-coms, no In-coms to be paid at our coming in to Jeſus Chriſt; there
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170112:24"/>are no Precedaneous conditions: Grace is free, and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is free, and Chriſt is free, and His Love is free: there is an infinite Propenſion in Jeſus Chriſt, to communicate this His Grace to the children of men. This is the third Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> As Chriſt is infinitly willing: So (in the Fourth place) there is nothing, either in Heaven, or in earth that can hinder Him from doing al. For now, grant all the former Three: That there is an infinite treaſury of Grace in Chriſt. That He hath not received it for Himſelf, but others. That He is infinitly willing to give it out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the children of men. Yet, if He can be hindred; al the former is nothing: Mark therefore the Fourth, (and then we come to the Uſe.) There is nothing, either in Heaven, or Earth, that can hinder Jeſus Chriſt from communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting His Grace.</p>

Chapter of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> &amp; the 21. verſe. <hi>Noah</hi> being come out of the Ark, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering unto the Lord; <hi>The Lord ſmel'd a ſweet ſavour: and the Lord ſaid in His heart, I will not again curſe the ground any more for mans ſake; for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth.</hi> I think it ſhould rather be read thus, according to the <hi>Hebrew:</hi> I will not again curſe the ground any more for mans ſake; <hi>although</hi> the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth: <hi>although:</hi> ye read it, <hi>for:</hi> I wil not again curſe the ground any more for mans ſake; <hi>for,</hi> the imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of mans heart is evil from his youth: One would think He ſhould rather ſay thus: I wil curſe the ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, and I will bring a new floud, for the imagination of mans heart is evil from his youth. No, but the Covenant that God made with <hi>Noah,</hi> was thus: I do now make a Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with man-kind, that the world ſhall never be drow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned again: yea, <hi>Though</hi> man do ſin, yet the world ſhall not be drown'd again. This is the Covenant that the Lord made with <hi>Noah:</hi> The Lord did not make ſuch a Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as this: I do promiſe, that the world ſhall not be drown'd again, if man do not fin. No, but the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant that the Lord made with <hi>Noah</hi> was thus: But I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe the world ſhall not be drown'd again, <hi>Though</hi> men do ſin again: this is the Covenant the Lord made with <hi>Noah:</hi> it was ſo far from running upon a condition, that it runs croſſe to all conditions. So now the Lord ſaies concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning a poor Beleever: I do take this ſoul into Covenant with Me: Yea, and <hi>Though</hi> he do ſin, yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:170112:25"/>I will pardon him, and this ſoul ſhall never lye un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der water again, ſhall never lye under water again: his ſin ſhall not hinder My grace; he ſhall never lye under wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter again: for as the Covenant I made with <hi>Noah,</hi> ſuch is the Covenant I make with every beleever. And beloved, if indeed that we could hinder Chriſt, when He comes to communicate His grace; if our ſins could hinder: then we might reſiſt grace, with an <hi>Overcoming reſiſtance.</hi> 'Tis true, a man may reſiſt the grace of God, with <hi>A gain-ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſiſtance;</hi> but he cannot reſiſt the grace of God, with an overcoming reſiſtance. Whatſoever is overcome, is overcome by a ſtronger: Man, (I ſay) cannot reſiſt with an overcoming reſiſtance. Pray do but conſider well the Covenant of Grace:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36 26, 27.</note> ſaies the Lord in that: <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart of ſtone, and I will give an heart of fleſh: and I will cauſe ye to walk in my waies; and I will put My Spirit in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you.</hi> I will take away the heart of ſtone: What is that? a ſtone is hard, a hard thing does not yeeld to the touch, a ſoft thing yeelds. <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had a hard heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he yeelded not. When therefore, the Lord makes ſuch a promiſe as this; <hi>I will take away the heart of ſtone:</hi> What is His meaning? His meaning is plainly, I will take away the un-yeelding, the reſiſting diſpoſition that is in man. Now therefore, when the Lord makes ſuch a promiſe as this: <hi>That He will put His Spirit into them, and cauſe them to walk in His waies:</hi> Our reſiſting can be no hindrance: Why? becauſe the Lord hath made a promiſe to take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way our reſiſting. If the Covenant had run thus: <hi>I will put My Spirit into you, and cauſe you to walk in My waies;</hi> upon this condition, that you do not reſiſt, then we could hinder: but the Lord in the ſame promiſe that He does ſay, <hi>I will put My Spirit into them, and cauſe them to walk in My waies:</hi> He doth alſo promiſe to take away the reſiſting heart, to take away the ſpirit of reſiſting. <hi>I will take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the heart of ſtone:</hi> there's the reſiſting: <hi>And I will cauſe them to walk in My waies.</hi> So that our ſins cannot hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>

                  <p>Now then, put al theſe together: There's an infinit trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of grace, and holineſs in Jeſus Chriſt. This He hath not received for Himſelfe, but for others. There is an infinite propenſion, and willingneſs in Him, to give out this grace unto the children of men. And nothing either in Heaven or earth can hinder Him: Surely therefor, there is the Communication of the Fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, unto all Beleevers</p>
                  <p>You will ſay unto me then: <label type="milestone">

                     </label> Why are Beleevers then ſo empty of Grace? 'Tis the ordinary complaint: Oh! I am full of evil: Oh my heart is empty of all that is good: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leevers they complain thus: How can this Doctrine be true, if this experience be good?</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Though there be a communication of the Fulneſſe of Chriſt unto all Beleevers: yet He does commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate as a univerſal Cauſe. The univerſall Cauſe doth ſeldom or never produce particular effects, but with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of particular Cauſes. The Sun is the univerſal Cauſe of all the fruitfulneſſe that is upon the earth: Yet notwithſtanding, it does produce the Fruit, (your Corne, Barly, and Rye, and Wheat;) with the help of man: The
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:170112:26"/>ground is plowen, and ſowen. The River, or the Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain is the univerſal Cauſe of the Water that yee have in your houſes: but yet notwithſtanding, you have not this Water, but by pipes, and conveyance; and when ye want water in your houſe, you do not ſay; There is no water in the Thames, there's no water in the Fountain: No, but ſurely the pipe is broken, the pipe is ſtopt; or we want ſome pipe or other. So now, when you want Grace, and when you are empty of Grace; you are not to ſay; Oh! it is becauſe there is not enough in Chriſt, or Chriſt is not willing; but rather, ſurely the pipe is broken, or we want this, or that Ordinance: the pipe is not clean, the pipe is ſtopt, and therefore we are ſo empty of Grace as we are.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Though there be a communication of the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Chriſt unto all Beleevers: yet notwith ſtanding he does it in proportion. (Mark) Chriſt does give unto every man according to the place that he bears in his body: As the ſoul, the ſoul ſends forth life, and motion to all the members; but the ſoul does not give a hearing faculty unto the eye, nor the ſoul does not give a ſeeing faculty unto the eare; neither can the foot ſay, I have nothing from the ſoul, becauſe I cannot ſpeak like the tongue: neither can the tongue ſay, I have nothing from the ſoul, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not walk like the foot. So the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, He doth obſerve what place every man doth bear in His Body, &amp; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly He doth give forth Grace unto men. You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay thus: Surely, I have none of Chriſt, becauſe I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not pray, and do ſo as others do: But mark, what is the place the you do bear in the Body of Chriſt, and you may go to Chriſt for ſtrength for that: you may ſay thus, Lord through thy Grace thou haſt given me ſuch a place in Thy Body, and I want ſtrength for that; O! let me have it from Thee.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Though there be a communication of the Fulneſſe of Chriſt unto all Beleevers: yet 'tis according to their neceſſities, and wants. The lace (you know) 'tis laid upon the ſeam; upon the ſeam there lyes the lace: lace
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:170112:26"/>indeed, may be laid upon the whol cloath; but ordinari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, your ſilken-lace, your ſilver-lace, your golden-lace; 'tis laid upon the ſeam. Now the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, He knows all the ſeams of your life, all the ſeams of your life: there He laies His Golden-Lace on. Mark therefore, what are the ſeams of thy life, and ſee if Chriſt hath not laid on ſomething there. pa Take but theſe Four Conſiderations together, and there is a ſufficient Anſwer to that Objection.</p>
                  <p>I come to the Application.<note place="margin">Applic.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>And whilſt I ſtand upon this point: Me thinks here I ſee, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the tranſcendant excellency of the Saints, &amp; of Beleevers; and the <hi>betterneſs</hi> of their condition, above the men of the world, though they be never ſo Rich, or Great, Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! Every man is according to the fulneſſe that he doth live upon: There is the Fulneſſe of the Earth;<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10 26.</note> 
                     <hi>The Earth is the Lords, and the Fulneſs thereof.</hi> And wicked men, they are ſaid to be filled with this: <hi>Whoſe bellies Thou filleſt with hid Treaſures. Pſalme</hi> the 17. And there is the Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt: And of this Fulneſſe the Saints, and Beleevers do all receive, and partake. Look therefore, what a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence there is between theſe fulneſſe's The fulneſie of the Earth; And the Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt: ſuch a mighty difference, in point of excellency, there is between a Belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, though he be never ſo poor: and a wicked man-though he be never ſo rich. Give me leave a little, to open the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of theſe Fulneſſes to you; that ſo you may ſee the difference betwwen men, and men, and be incouraged un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a godly courſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, The fulneſs of the world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> it is fulneſs made up of many things. <hi>Martha, Martha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke</hi> 10.41.</note> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>thou art buſied about many thing.</hi> 'Tis a fulneſs made up of many things; and therefore not a Homogenial fulneſs: The fulnes of Chriſt is a fulnes made up of one thing, the Deitie, in whom the God-head dwells; and therefore 'tis a Homo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genial fulneſs; every part of it is fulneſs: every part of a
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:170112:27"/>Homogenial body, hath the name of the whole: Wvery part of water, is called water, though it be but a drop: Every part of fire, is fire, though it be but a ſpark: And E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very part of Heaven, it is called Heaven, though it be but a corner of Heaven. And ſo, every part of the Fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, is fulneſs. As the Philoſophers ſay of the ſoul, <hi>Animatota in toto,</hi> that the ſoul is, wholly in the whol, and wholly in every part: So the Fulneſs of Chriſt, 'tis wholly in the Church, and 'tis wholly in every Beleever. Every Beleever may come and ſay, <hi>I have all Chriſt.</hi> But as for the fulneſs of the world, every one that hath the worlds fulneſs cannot ſay ſo; <hi>I have all the worlds fulneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The fulneſs of the earth, is a fulneſs made up of the worſer things. The world, it is a great Body, and it hath in it ſome things that are of a groſſer, more droſſy nature: and ſome things that are of a finer nature. The fulneſs of the earth, it is of the droſſy, and the groſſer part of the world: Oh! but the Fulneſs of Chriſt, it is of the finer part; and the fulneſs that does come from Him unto Beleevers, the beſt of the beſts; wine of the lees; and mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row out of the bones; and wine well refined; 'tis of the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner part of the world: The other is but the groſſer, the thicker, the dirtier, the more groſſer part.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> The fulneſs of the earth, is a fulneſs that runs into emptineſs; a fulneſs that hath an hole at the bottom: Like unto an hour glaſſe: if you turn it up, the upper part of the glaſſe is full of ſand: but becauſe it hath an hole at the bottom, and there ſtands a glaſſe beneath it as big as it ſelf; it empties it ſelf into that galſſe. Then you turn up the glaſſe again, and that is full: but becauſe that hath an hole at the bottom, it runs out, having an empty glaſſe beneath it, and this fulneſs runs into it. So now, ;tis with the worlds fulnes: a man he hath a great eſtate, he hath his glaſſe full of ſand: I but becauſe his children, and his family ſtands under him; his ſand runs into them, and he is ſoon emptied; he is ſoon emptied in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them. Then, when the father is dead, and gone; and
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:170112:27"/>hath emptied out his fulneſs into his children; the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drens glaſſe is turn'd up: but they having children under them, and houſe under them; their ſand alſo, is ſoon run out, it runs out into emptineſs. Thus, all the fulneſs of the world, 'tis but a fulneſs that hath a hole at the bottom, that runs into emptineſs. Oh! but the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, the fulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt it is a dwelling fulneſs; His ſulneſs runs out into Leleevers, &amp; yet He is ful Himſelf: In Him the fulnes of the God head dwels, it dwelleththere.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, The fulneſs of the Earth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> it can never ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the better part of man, [the ſoul] it can never ſatisfie that. All ſatisfaction, and contentment ariſes from the conjunction, of a Convenient with a Convenient; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of ſutables. If a man have never ſo great an Eſtate, if his heart be not ſuted to it, he hath no content. If a man have never ſo ſmall an Eſtate, if his heart be ſuted to it, he is content. So that now, all content ariſes from ſutable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſsm, the conjunction of ſutables. What ſutableneſs is there between the fulneſs of the earth; and the better part of man, the ſoul? Mark. Properly a thing is never ſaid to be full, till it be full of that for which it was made: A mans Cheſt, a Cheſt or Trunk is not ſaid to be full of aire; though it be ful of aire; yet notwithſtanding, we ſay the Cheſt, or Trunk is empty, becauſe 'tis not fil'd with that for which it was made. And ſo, take one of theſe meeting Houſes; though the place be full of ſtooles, yet notwithſtanding, though (I ſay) the place be full of ſtools, or full of air; yet we ſay, the Church is empty: becauſe though it be full, yet 'tis not full of that for which it was made, full of people. So now, take a man that hath all the fulneſs of the earthl: becauſe that his ſoul was never made, his better part was never made for the fulneſs of the earth, therefore he is ſaid to be empty, in the midſt of all his fulneſs his heart is empty; and the man is an emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty man, becauſe his heart is not full of that for which he was made, and that is Chriſt, that is Chriſt; the fulneſs of Chriſt in him; he is an empty man all this while. Oh
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:170112:28"/>but the fulneſs Jeſus Chriſt, is a ſoul-ſatisfying fulneſs: <hi>He that drinks of the water that I ſhall give him</hi> (ſaies He) <hi>ſhall never thieſt again.</hi>

                  <p>Fiftly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> The fulneſs of the earth cannot commend a man unto God, or make him more lovely or beautiful in the eyes of God. The poor, vain, fooliſh ſtage-player thinks him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf brave, and a jolly man-while he is in kings cloathes; or while he is acting the part of a King: but the wiſe ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator, he ſaies: And is he that does but act the Kings part, or hath the Kings cloaths on, ſo brave a man, what is a King indeed. Beloved the Lord He ſees all we have, and do; ſtands by as a wiſe ſpectator; and when men brave it out with the worlds fulneſs: I, what then is the man, that acts the Fulneſſe of Chriſt? Is he ſo brave a man that hath a poſſeſſion here land, and houſe; What is he then that hath an eternal inheritance? If there fall but the leaſt drop of the Rulneſs of Chriſt upon a ſoul, it makes the ſoul lovely, and beautiful in the eyes of God. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.4. The Apoſtle ſpeaking of the adorning of women: ſaies he (at the 3 verſe) <hi>Whoſe adorning, let it not be that out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward adorning, of playting the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparrel: but let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is incorruptible; even the Ornament of a meek, and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay: All other Ornaments, plaiting of hair, and gold, and the like; is of no price in the eyes of God: Oh! but a quiet ſpirit, and a meek ſpirit; one drop of the Fulneſs of Chriſt falling upon the ſoul, makes the ſoul lovely in the fight of God; is of great price.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> The fulneſſe of the Earth, is a fulneſſe that is mixt with poiſon, ſin. &amp; the curſe of God. What pleaſure or delight can a man take in drinking, when he ſhall conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der with himſelf, that poiſon is mixt withal? this is good, or ſweer liquor (ſaies he) indeed: Oh! but there is poiſon in the Cup, and therefore I wil not meddle with it. Take all the Fulneſſe of the world; and if it be not mixt with
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:170112:28"/>the Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, there is poiſon in it, the Curſe of God in it, the wrath of God there: and therefore, what pleaſure, what contentment can a man take therein, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Fulneſſe of Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The Fulneſſe of the Earth is a defiling Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. When a thing is mixed with any thing that is worſe than it ſelf, it is defiled thereby: If ſilver be mingled with gold, the ſilver is not defil'd thereby, becauſe gold is better than the ſilver: but if ſilver be mingled with lead, the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is defil'd, becauſe 'tis mingled with ſomething that is worſe than it ſelf. So now, if a man be mingled with Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, and Heavenly things, his heart is not defil'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by, becauſe they are better than himſelf: but if a mans heart be mingled with the things of the world, his heart is defil'd, becauſe 'tis mingled with ſomething that is worſe than himſelf: and the more a mans heart is mingled with the things of the earth, the more defil'd it is. As a dog, that hath bemir'd himſelf, the more he fawnes upon you, the more he dirties you: If you take a dog abroad with you into the fields, and he run into a dirty ditch, or the river: after he is dirty, you will not ſuffer him to come neer you and themore he fawns upon you, and leaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you the more he defiles you. Truly, ſuch is the earths, and the world fulneſs: as (I ſay) a dog, the more it fawns upon you, and falls upon you, the more it defles you: Oh! but the Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt is a pure Fulneſſe, a Fulneſs that is full of pureneſſe.</p>
                  <p>Eightly, Take al the Fulneſſe of the world, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> and though it be never ſo much, it fals under your expectation: Sink your expectation as low as you can, and yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, it wil fall below your expectation. As for the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, raiſe, and ſcrue up your expectation as high as you can, and yet you ſhall find more therein then ever you expected.</p>
                  <p>Ninthly, As for the fulneſſe of the earth, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> ſomtimes 'tis better wanted than injoyed: It may make you miſerable, it cannot make you happy. Oh! but the Fulneſſe of Jeſus
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:170112:29"/>Chriſt, it can never make you miſerable, it will certainly make you happy, there is no ſuch time, wherein 'tis better wanted, than injoyed.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> As for the Fulneſſe of the earth, (again) It coſts a man many times more than 'tis worth: it coſts him his Time, his precious Thoughts, his Soul; much is laid out for it, much care to get it, much fear to keep it, and much grief to loſe it. Oh! but the Fulneſſe of Jeſus Chriſt, it coſts him nothing:<note place="margin">

                  <p>And again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="11"/> (to name no more of theſe) Take all the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of the Earth, and though it be never ſo much: it is not able to anſwer you with Love; to return you Love, for your Love. The greaten, &amp; nobleſt Gift of the world, is Love. That is alwaies unworthy of your love, that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not anſwer your love again. If you have a full bagg, If you have a full Table; if you have a full Houſe: theſe ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes cannot anſwer you with love again; but it can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>file your own love. Oh! but the Fulneſſe of Chriſt, it can anſwer you with Love for Love, it gives you a better Love than you brought: it Nobilitates, and Meliorates, and raiſes your own love forever. Behold! This is the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, this is the Fulneſſe that the Saints, that Beleevers do partake in, that they do receive of: and they may come to this Fulneſſ of Jeſus Chriſt, and they may ſay: Of this Fulneſſe, of this Fulneſſe wee have all received: As thoſe wicked men, they may go unto the fulneſſe of the Earth, and they may ſay indeed; Of this fulneſſe we have all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; but as for that Fulneſſe we have none of it.

See what is ſpoken concerning Chriſt to this purpoſe that now I am upon: <hi>Thou haſt aſcended on high, Thou haſt led captivity captive: Thou haſt received gifts for men;</hi> ('tis ſpoken of Chriſt) <hi>yea, for the Rebellious Alſo;</hi> Mark that word: Thou haſt received gifts for men; yea, <hi>For the Rebellious Alſo.</hi> Well then, is there ever a Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Childe in this Congregation? Is there ever a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Drunkard, that hath taken up arms againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? Is there ever a rebellious Swearer, or an unclean heart here, that hath taken up arms againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt? (Saies the Text) <hi>He hath received gifts for men; yea, for the Rebellious Alſo;</hi> The Reaſon why you have not theſe gifts, is, becauſe you do not come to Chriſt. Oh! But if you would come to Chriſt, (Mark) If you would come to Chriſt, you that are Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, if you would come to Jeſus Chriſt, He hath theſe gifts, or Grace by Him; if you would come to Him, you ſhould have theſe gifts from Him. Who would not throw down his weapons now? Is there ever a Rebel in all this Congregation, that hath taken up arms againſt the Lord Jeſus Chriſt heretofore? Me thinks he ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged hence to come unto Jeſus Chriſt. <hi>Bodin</hi> hath a ſtory concerning a great Rebel, that had made a great, and ſtrong party againſt a Roman Emperour: &amp; the Emperour
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:170112:31"/>makes Proclamation; that who ever could bring in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel, either alive, or dead, ſhould have ſuch a great ſum of money. The Rebel hearing of this, he comes in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, preſents himſelf unto the Emperour, and demands the ſum of money. Saies the Emperour; if now, I ſhould put him to death, the world would think, that I did it to ſave my money: notwithſtanding all his former rebellion, the Emperour pardons him, and gave him the ſum of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. Oh! would a Heathen Emperour do thus by a poor Rebel? And if thou, (man or woman) wilt throw down thy weapons, and come in unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, do you think that the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will not give to you thoſe gifts that He hath received for you? Certainly He will. Oh! me thinks therefore, every poor ſinner ſhould now hang upon this laſt word; yea, <hi>For the rebellious Alſo.</hi> Hath the Lord Jeſus Chriſt receiued gifts for men, and <hi>for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious Alſo?</hi> I wil for ever hang upon that word, <hi>Alſo.</hi> Oh! I have bin a Rebel: I have bin an unclean Rebel; I have bin a ſwearing Rebel; I have bin a drunken Rebel: Oh! Lord, I will throw down my weapon, and hang upon this word, <hi>Alſo:</hi> Hath He received gifts for men; and for the rebellious <hi>Alſo?</hi> Oh! I will come in unto Him. Oh! what a mighty incouragement is here for all, good and bad, to come in unto Jeſus Chriſt? Come Drunkard; Come Swearer; Come Unclean heart; Come Sabbath-breaker; Come lying-Children; Come ſtealing-Servants: Oh! Come unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt that you may be fil'd for ever. Oh! Come unto Chriſt, that you may leave your ſins. Here is incouragement to all, good and bad, to come unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>

For as <hi>Strigelius</hi> does well obſerve: (at the 7. verſe, the verſe next following this text) it is ſaid: <hi>In his daies ſhall the righteous flouriſh: and abundance of peace ſo long as the moon endureth. Solomon</hi> did not live ſo long as the moon endures. This therefore, is to be underſtood of Chriſt. And at the 5. verſe, it is ſaid: <hi>They ſhall fear thee as long as the Sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.</hi> They did not fear <hi>Solomon;</hi> men did not fear <hi>Solomon</hi> as long as the Sun and moon endures, through all generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. This therefore, muſt be underſtood of Chriſt. Now, ſee therefore, what is ſaid of Chriſt, and concerning His

I will be as a dew</hi> (ſaies the Lord, in the 14. of <hi>Hoſea</hi>) <hi>unto</hi> Iſrael: and then follows fruitfulneſs.</p>

And this was a Type of the Grace of Chriſt: when the <hi>Jewes</hi> were bedewed with the Grace of Chriſt, then all the Nations round about, they were dry: And then, when God bedewed the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the Nations round about with His Grace; then the <hi>Jews</hi> were dry, and they are dry to this day.</p>
                  <p>Again, The rain, <hi>falleth</hi> ('tis the Scripture phraſe) the rain falleth; and falleth upon the earth: and the earth is a <hi>recipient</hi> to receive it: it is meer recipient at the firſt, and then brings forth it's fruit: the Rain falleth. And ſo doth the Grace of Chriſt: the Grace of Chriſt falls upon the ſouls of men and women (ſaith the Text here) <hi>He ſhall come down like the rain upon the mowne graſs.</hi> So doth the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt, it comes down upon a poor ſoul: All in a way of receiving, al in a way of receiving; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever grace, or holineſs a man hath on this ſide Heaven, it is all in a way of Receiving.</p>
                  <p>And this will appear further to you, if you conſider: The inſufficiency of Nature. The Supernaturallity of Grace. The Shortneſs of all means that are appointed thereunto. The work and nature of Faith. And the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and true behaviour of Prayer.</p>

Sin it ſelf, will ceaſe to ſin, that it may ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength to ſin. But now; a man by nature he cannot overcome it. And therfore, in the 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 15.57. the Apoſtle ſaies thus: <hi>But thanks be to God, which giveth us the Victory, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Victories, and all Victories is through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And if in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> all Victories were given from God, all outward Victories were given from Him: Then much more in the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> are all our Spiritual Victories, (the former being but Types of theſe) much more are all our Spiritual Victories, then to be given to God. Now you ſee how it was with <hi>David,</hi> in the 18. <hi>Pſalme,</hi> concerning outward Victories he gives all to God. Saies he there (at the 32 verſe,) <hi>It is God that girdeth me with ſtrength: He maketh my feet, like hindes feet: He teacheth my hands to war, ſo that a Bow of ſteel is broken by mine Arms.</hi> And at the 2. verſe (ſaies he) <hi>The Lord is my Rock, my For treſs, my Deliverer: my God, my ſtrength in whom I wil truſt; my Buckler, and the horn of my Salvation, &amp; mine high Tower.</hi> As if all his War-like ſtrength and skill were from God.

                     <hi>As a man is unable to overcome any ſin: So alſo, if he be fallen, he is unable to riſe again. Peter</hi> himſelf muſt have a look from Chriſt, before he could repent. As if Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt had ſaid to him; <hi>Peter,</hi> thou art now down in the dirt, and I know thou canſt not riſe, unleſſe I give forth My hand unto thee: then here is My hand; and ſo He did heave him up. Every ſin that a man does commit, he is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken captive by it, more or leſſe: ſin is a captivity. Now, <hi>Voluntas non eſt libera, niſi liberata:</hi> A man is not free, unleſſe freed. If the Son make you free, you are free indeed; but elſe not at all. Every ſin that a man does commit, it is a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal wound, a death of the ſoul, ſin is. A man may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to kill himſelfe, but being kil'd, he cannot raiſe him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The Ship having his rudder broken, cannot go where it wil but muſt go where the Tempeſt pleaſes. And Beloved, there is never a fin that a man commits, but he does ſtrike upon his rudder, he does ſtrike upon the earth withal; and he does loſe his rudder. A poor ſheep is able for to loſe it ſelf, &amp; to wander: but being loſt, is not able to come home a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaim. Yea, our Savior ſaies, in the Parable of the loſt-ſheep, (meaning loſt-man) The loſt-ſheep is taken by the ſhepherd, or the good-man that finds it, and is layd upon his ſhoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſo brought back again. What is this ſhoulder, but the ſtrength of Chriſt? And indeed, if a poor ſoul, if a wandting, poor, loſt ſoul be not laid on the ſhoulder of Jeſus Chriſt: he will loſe, and wander unto all Eternity, will loſe himſelf, and wander for ever. This is wel expreſt (as an Ancient does obſerve) in the example of <hi>Adam:</hi> when <hi>Adam</hi> had ſinned, and fallen; <hi>Adam</hi> was not able to return again (Let us mark it the rather, becauſe <hi>Adam,</hi> he was our Great Common-father; and in his example we may all ſee our own faces,) Saies he, <hi>Adam</hi> being fallen, he could not riſe again: but when <hi>Adam</hi> was fallen, What does he? Then he ſets himſelf, for to make himſelfe cloaths of ſigg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaves, that ſo he might be freed from the injury of the weather: he could mind his cloathes, and do ſomething to take away his ſhame; but not one thought of God, not
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170112:35"/>one word of God whom he had loſt. And ſo now man, man having finned; What does he do? He can mind his cloathes, he can mind the affairs of the world; thoſe things that concern this life, and his body: Oh! but not one word, not one thought of God, until the Voice of the Lord be heard: And what then? Then <hi>Adam</hi>-like he may be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed, and may be afraid,; but yet no repentance till Chriſt comes. Naturally a man being fallen, he is unable to riſe again.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. <hi>As he is unable to riſe again:</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>So he is unable to ſtand, to hold, to continue: though he ſhould riſe up again, he is unable to ſtand, he is unable to hold, to continue.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>David</hi> ſeeing his people in a good frame, he prayes, <hi>That the Lord would continue that good in the thoughts of their heart, and that for ever.</hi> And ſo the Apoſtle in the 1 <hi>Peter,</hi> 5.10.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.18.</note> 
                     <hi>But the God of all Grace, who hath called us unto His eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Glory by Chriſt Jeſus, after ye have ſuffered a while, make ye perfect, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you.</hi> (Pray mark the words) The God of all Grace, ſtabliſh, ſtrengthen, ſettle you. He does not ſay; The God of <hi>Nature</hi> ſettle you: Oh! 'tis an act of Grace, of great Grace, of rich Grace to be ſettled, it is an act of great Grace to be truly ſettled, As <hi>Hierome</hi> excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently notes; God is alwaies a giver; God is alwaies a beſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer: It ſhal not ſuffice me that God hath once given, unleſs He would alwaies give. You know the parable concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the ſtrong man, that ye reade of, in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. being caſt out by a ſtronger then he, and yet returns again. The Devil is this ſtrong man in ſome great, and groſſe ſin: now, though he be caſt out; yet notwithſtanding the room being emptied, though it be garniſht with moral vertues, and Evangelical gifts yet the room being left empty of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt not keeping the houſe: ſaies the Devil, the houſe is mine ſtill: and therefore (ſaies he) I will return to mine houſe, he calls it <hi>his</hi> houſe all this while; Though the ſtrong man were caſt out, and though the room were ſwept, and garniſht, yet he calls it <hi>his</hi> houſe ſtill, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt did not keep there, and continue
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170112:36"/>there. So that, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt muſt have the <hi>Kee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping</hi> of the houſe, as well as the <hi>Sweeping</hi> of the houſe. Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally, a man is unable to hold, to ſtand, and continue, though he do riſe.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> (Pray mark it, that you may ſee, what an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency there is unto what is good, that ſo we may be brought unto more dependence on Chriſt.) <hi>As a man is una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſtand, and perſevere: So alſo, he is unable to any one good work; Spiritually, Evangelically good. We are not able</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>as of our ſelves,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>to think a good thought, to ſpeak a good word; but all our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> And <hi>Bradwardin,</hi> he reaſons the caſe very well: (Saies he thus <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

So (ſaies he) if God ſhould give habitual grace to a man, if the ſtrength for the action ſhould not be from God, he might boaſt; True indeed, I had the habit from God, the habitual grace from God, but the action is my own, the ſpirit of the action is my own: he had now wherein to boaſt. But all boaſting is cut off, as you ſhall hear by and by. And therefore Naturally a man is unable to every work: Not only the habit is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved; but ſtrength for the action alſo, 'tis all received.</p>

Ye know what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaies, (and I pray conſider it) in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.1. <hi>And you hath He quickned, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. Even you</hi> (at the 5. v.) <hi>even when we were dead in ſins hath quickned us together with Chriſt; by Grace ye are ſaved.</hi> (Mark) Twice the Apoſtle brings in that ſentence: be brings it in again at the 8. verſe: <hi>For by Grace ye are ſaved:</hi> why twice? Not only to ſhew that the progreſſe of a Chriſtian is by Grace, but the very firſt begining, and ſetting out, 'tis al of grace: <hi>By Grace ye are ſaved.</hi> 'Tis a good ſpeech of <hi>Auſtin,</hi> Grace is no way Grace, unleſſe it be every way free. Now can a poor dead man prepare himſelfe unto life? Did <hi>Lazarus</hi> prepare himſelf to life? Could he do it? Could <hi>Lazarus</hi> do it? There is (ſaith the Philoſopher) a proportion al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies between the Action, and the terme of the Action. Now what proportion is there between Nature and Grace? <hi>No man</hi> (ſaies our Savior) <hi>comes unto the Son,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44</note> 
                     <hi>but whom the Father draws,</hi> thus ſaies our Savior. Oh! but (ſaies <hi>Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius</hi>) I can go unto Jeſus Chriſt by my own preparation, I can prepare, I can draw my ſelf unto Jeſus Chriſt, or I can draw Chriſt to me. Beloved! In natural Actions, there needs alwaies preparations to the introducing of forms: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe in the way of Generation of Nature, things are wrought by degrees. As for example now: If a great log lie in the mud; before you can carry it away, you muſt loo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen it from the mud: but the logg doth not looſen it ſelfe: And ſo, if wood be to be burnt; firſt it muſt be dried, there is preparing the wood to be burnt, becauſe the thing is to be done by degrees. But in the converſion of a poor ſinner,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170112:37"/>the work is done in a moment, it is no natural work, God infuſes Grace there; and therefore there needs no prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration there. And therefore <hi>Bradwardine,</hi> he reaſons the caſe very well thus, If (ſaies he) a man can prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then the preparation either helps forward, or cauſes the following grace; if it does not help forward, nor cauſe the following grace, then it does not prepare, that which does not help, does not prepare: &amp; if it does help forward the following grace, or cauſe it, that God muſt give a fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing grace as a reward of this preparation; then ſurely, this preparation makes a man pleaſing in the eyes of God: for, will God reward a man for a work that does not make him pleaſing in the eyes of God? But how can a man be pleaſing in the eyes of God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.6.</note> without Faith? <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi> So that a man cannot prepare himſelf to what is good. Put all theſe together: A man cannot naturally overcome a ſin, a temptation, though ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſmall: He cannot riſe when he is fallen: he cannot ſtand though he ſhould riſe: yea, he is unable to any good work, ſimply in it ſelf: and he is not able to prepare him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto what is good. Surely therefore, all is in a way of Receiving: what ever grace one hath, he hath it in a way of Receiving. This is the firſt Argument.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> This truth is alſo argued from the <hi>Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turallity</hi> of Grace: Grace is a <hi>Supernatural thing,</hi> and is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in Scripture phraſe, <hi>The Seed of God: The Image of Chriſt: The Divine Nature: The good and perfect Gift that comes from above from the Father of Lights:</hi> It is wrought in the ſoul by the infinite, and Almighty Power of God; the ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer wherewith God Created Heaven and Earth at the firſt. And therefore 'tis called a <hi>Creation,</hi> in <hi>Ephe.</hi> 2.10. <hi>We are His Workmanſhip, created unto good Works.</hi> The ſame po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer that the Lord uſed in raiſing up Chriſt from the dead, is alſo put forth in the converſion of every ſinner.</p>
                  <p>And beſides, When the Lord is pleaſed to convert, and draw a poor ſinner unto Himſelf, He does not alwaies take thoſe that are the beſt, thoſe that are the wiſeſt, thoſe that are
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170112:37"/>the moſt moral, Civil men; He does not alwaies take the moſt Prudent: but many times the Lord takes the worſt; <hi>Paul, Zacheus, Matthew,</hi> the <hi>Jailour,</hi> divers others. And if you look into the 33. Chapter of <hi>Job,</hi> where you have the plat-form (indeed) of mans converſion: you ſhall find there, in what a time God takes a man to Convert him: (at the 14. verſe) <hi>God ſpeaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceives it not: In a dream, in a viſion of the night, when deep ſleep fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth upon men, in ſlumbrings upon the bed: Then He openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction, That He may with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from man.</hi> When man leaſt thinks of it, then God comes, in a dream, in a viſion of the night, when deep ſleep falleth upon a man, and in ſlumbrings upon the bed: Then he openeth the ears of men, and ſealeth their inſtruction. What does all this argue then? But that grace, grace is infuſed, grace is ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural; Oh! there is a ſupernaturallity in ſaving grace: Surely therefore, all is in a way of Receiving, all is Received. That is a Second Argument.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly. This truth is alſo argued, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> from the <hi>Shortneſs of the means of grace.</hi> Much means of grace appointed; but take the means as it is in it ſelf without Gods appointment, or inſtitution upon it, &amp; you wil find that all means are too ſhort to reach the end. For example: In the old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when the Lord would take in <hi>Jericho,</hi> and break down the walls of <hi>Jericho;</hi> He Commands,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joſh.</hi> 6.4</note> 
                     <hi>The Rams horns ſhould be blown.</hi> Take the blowing of the Rams-horns as lying under Gods appointment, and ſo this action was ſufficient for to break down the walls: but take the action of blowing the <hi>Rams-horns</hi> by it ſelf, and ſo it was too ſhort. So the Lord commands <hi>Naaman,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Kings</hi> 5.10.</note> 
                     <hi>To go and waſh himſelf in the water of</hi> Jordan: take this action of <hi>Naaman</hi> waſhing himſelf in the water; take it (I ſay) without Gods Commandement: take it with Gods Commandement, Gods Appointment, ſo it was ſufficient to reach his Cure, and heale him of his Leproſy: but now, take the action as it was in it ſelf, without the Appointment, and inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:170112:38"/>of God, and ſo it was too ſhort to reach his Cure. So in the new Teſtament:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 9.6.</note> our Savior Chriſt, <hi>He takes ſpittle and clay for to cure a mans eyes:</hi> Take this under Chriſts ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and ſo it's ſufficient to reach the cure; but take it without, and ſo ſhort. So God did appoint in <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme</hi> a man ſhould be waſhed in water; and in the <hi>Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> we ſhould eat bread, and drink wine, for the beget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and increaſing of Faith. Take theſe actions as they lie under Gods Appointment, and Inſtitution, they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to reach this end: but take theſe actions as they are in themſelves, waſhing in water; and eating bread, and drinking wine; they are all too ſhort; all too ſhort, either to beget, or increaſe Grace. Well now, why does the Lord ſtil appoint ſuch means, as in themſelves are too ſhort for the end whereto appointed? Surely, not only for this reaſon, that he might teach us, that the thing done is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by the appointment, then by the uſe of means: but alſo to ſhow thus much, That though we do uſe the means, yet notwithſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding in the uſe of the means, we do not attain the thing by the uſe thereof; but that in the uſing of means, and waiting there, we ſhall receive ſtrength from God to do it, to attain the end. Whenſoever therefore, you con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the ſhortneſs of the means appointed, conclude thus, That all is in a way of Receiving: therefore God hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the means that are in themſelves ſhort.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> This Doctrine is further argued, <hi>From the work, and nature of Faith.</hi> There is no Grace that the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture puts more upon, than Faith. (Mark I pray) In the old Teſtament, all the <hi>Victories</hi> are put on <hi>Faith:</hi> In the new Teſtament, all the <hi>Cures:</hi> if thou canſt but <hi>Beleeve</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>According to thy Faith be it unto thee.</hi> Yea, Beloved, if you look into the new Teſtament, you ſhal find, that the ſame works that are given to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> are given to <hi>Faith,</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, He is ſaid for to <hi>Sanctifie the ſoul:</hi> So doth <hi>Faith, Faith purifies the heart</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle.) Jeſus Chriſt, He is ſaid <hi>for to juſtifie a ſinner:</hi> So does <hi>Faith</hi> too: <hi>Being juſtified by Faith: Romans, the</hi> 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> He is ſaid for to <hi>ſave
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170112:38"/>the ſoul,</hi> He is called our <hi>Savior:</hi> So doth <hi>Faith</hi> too: <hi>By Faith ye are ſaved.</hi> What's the Reaſon now, that the Lord does eſpecially ſet the Crown upon the head of <hi>Faith?</hi> Some think it is for this Reaſon; Becauſe that Faith doth unite the ſoul unto Jeſus Chriſt: But ſo does Love, Love is an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Union; and all Grace unites to Chriſt; as every ſin ſeperates, ſo every Grace unites. Others think 'tis for this Reaſon: Becauſe that as Faith ſets the Crown upon the head of Chriſt: So God ſets the Crown upon the head of Faith: and this is true. For as the Lord does honor thoſe perſons moſt, that honor Him moſt: So He wil honor thoſe Graces moſt, that honor Him moſt. But beſides this, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, the great Reaſon is this; why the Lord does thus ſet all over upon Faith: (I ſay) becauſe that Faith, in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it, is a Receiving Grace. And therefore <hi>John</hi> having ſaid in this 1. Chap. of <hi>Joh.</hi> and the 12. verſe. <hi>To as many as received Him, He gave power to be called the Sons of God.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains himſelf by this afterward in the ſame verſe; <hi>Even to them that Beleeve on His Name.</hi> So that <hi>Beleeving</hi> is nothing elſe but <hi>Receiving the Grace of God:</hi> the nature of Faith, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Receive the Truth, or the Receiving of Jeſus Chriſt: the proper work, and nature of Faith being to Receive. Now therefore when the Lord does put al upon Faith, and Faith in it's nature is a Receiving; plainly it holds forth this Truth unto us, That all is in a way a Receiving: all Grace in a way of Receiving.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and laſtly. This Truth is argued alſo, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                     <hi>From the poſture, and true behavior of Prayer</hi> (Mark) <hi>Prayer,</hi> is nothing elſe, but the ſouls <hi>begging,</hi> or <hi>petitioning</hi> for ſomething from Heaven. A begger you know, when he begs, he holds forth, or he ſtretches forth his hand: noting a willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive. So you reade in Scripture, that when the ſoul is put into a poſture of <hi>Prayer,</hi> it is put into this poſture. Reade therefore what is ſaid, in <hi>Job,</hi> 11.13. <hi>If thou prepare thine heart,</hi> (<hi>or eſt abliſh thine heart,</hi> for ſo the word ſignifies) <hi>if thou prepare thine heart, and ſtretch out thine hands towards Him.</hi> That is, if thou doeſt <hi>Pray</hi> unto Him, thou <hi>ſtretcheſt
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170112:39"/>out</hi> thine hands unto Him. Now as one obſerves well: As it were a deriſion, or a mocking of God, to praiſe God, or to give God thanks for that which He doth not give, but I have in my own power: So it were alſo a mocking of God, to pray to God for that which is not in His hands to give, but in mine to do. Now my Beloved, What ever Grace, or Holineſſe a man hath, he is to pray for: pray for healing ſtrength; pray for quickning ſtrength; pray for confirming ſtrength; pray for ſtrength to pray: and ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the poſture of prayer is this, to ſtretch forth the hands, (which notes receiving) in that we are for to beg all Grace from God; it argues, all is in a way of Receiving, all, all good is in a way of Receiving: what ever Grace, or Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe a man hath on this ſide Heaven, 'tis all in a way of Receiving.</p>

                     </label> That this <hi>Cuts off all endeavour;</hi> if all be in a way of <hi>Receiving,</hi> then nothing to be done? This Doctrine is an Enemy to all Obedience, to all laboring, to al good Works, and to all performance, to al Endeavour.</p>

                     </label> The Apoſtle expreſly does ſpeak the contrary, as you may reade, (and I pray mark) in that 2<hi rend="sup">d</hi> Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippians: Wherefore</hi> (at the 12 verſe) ſaies he) <hi>my beloved, as ye have alwaies obeyed, not as in my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence only, but now much more in my abſence: work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling.</hi> Why? (at the 13 verſe) <hi>For it is God which worketh in you both to will, and to do, of His good pleaſure.</hi> Work out your own Salvation with fear and trembling: why? for all is in a way of Receiving; 'tis God, 'tis God that worketh all in all; 'tis God, 'tis God that does it, therefore work. Mark, how the Apoſtle argues: He does not argue, as many do: And I pray tell me if there be any here that think this Doctrin is againſt Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour; pray tell me, What Work or Endeavour? Either you would endeavour for to leave your fins; or you would endeavour to do what is good, to perform ſome good. If you would endeavour for to leave your ſins: there is no ſuch way, as to be truly, fully perſwaded in your heart of
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:170112:39"/>this truth, That all is in a way of Receiving. Mark therefore I pray, how the Apoſtle argues for that purpoſe, in the 1 <hi>Cor. Chap.</hi> 3. at the 3<hi rend="sup">d</hi> verſe: For (ſaies He) <hi>Ye are carnal;</hi> ye are carnal; <hi>for whereas there is among you envying, and ſtrife, and diviſions, are ye not carnal and walk as men?</hi> For while one ſaith, I am of <hi>Paul,</hi> and another, I am of <hi>Apollo,</hi> are ye not carnal? Well, but what courſe does the Apoſtle take to cure this carnallity? See what he ſaies, at the 6<hi rend="sup">th</hi> verſe: at the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> 
                     <hi>Who then is</hi> Paul? <hi>who is</hi> Paul? <hi>and who is</hi> Apollo? <hi>but Miniſters by whom ye beleeved, even as the Lord Gave to every man: I have planted,</hi> Apollo <hi>watered, but God gave the increaſe:</hi> So then, neither is he that <hi>planteth</hi> any thing, neither is he that <hi>watereth:</hi> but God that gives the <hi>Increaſe.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay thus: Here's diviſions among you; and one ſaies, I am for <hi>Paul;</hi> and I am for <hi>Apollo:</hi> Oh! but get your heart ſettled in this Truth, That all is of God, and all is of Chriſt, and all is in a way of Receiving; and then diviſions will be no more; there will be no more ſuch ſayings as theſe, I am for <hi>Paul,</hi> and I am for <hi>Apollo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And again, Would your endeavours be for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of what is good? The conſideration of this Truth that is now before you, is of great avail this way too. Saies <hi>Paul, I have labored more abundantly than they al, yet not I,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10.</note> 
                     <hi>but the Grace of Chriſt in me.</hi> Mark, yet not I, but the Grace of Chriſt in me. Labored more than they al, more abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than all, yet al from Chriſt, and yet all from Grace, and yet all in a way of Receiving. Surely, there is no ſuch way to gracious, and bleſſed endeavors, as the ſerious conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of this Truth that is now before you.</p>
                  <p>I'le give you Two Reaſons for it:</p>
                  <p>All Actions are carried upon two wheels, <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> As a Cart moves upon two wheels; ſo every Action is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried upon theſe two, <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love.</hi> The more ye <hi>love,</hi> the more ye move towards a thing: The more ye <hi>fear,</hi> the more ye move to avoid it: <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> the two great wheels of every motion. Now as for <hi>Love;</hi> what greater <hi>Love</hi> than this; That Jeſus Chriſt hath died for us, and worketh all
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:170112:40"/>our works for us, and in us? and <hi>Love</hi> cauſeth <hi>Love.</hi> As for <hi>Fear,</hi> Ye know there are ſome children, ſo long as they are kept in dependance upon the father, the father having not given them portions they are obedient to him: but if once the children have gotten their portions, and are come to live by themſelves, then no more obedience. If you have a man by the <hi>wriſt,</hi> and he knows that if you let him go, he fals down into ſome great river, and there he is loſt for ever: will not this man that you have by the wriſt, will not he be afraid now to offend you, knowing you have him thus by the <hi>wriſt?</hi> Beloved! this Doctrin tels us, that the Lord hath us all by the <hi>wriſt;</hi> we live in a continual dependance upon Him: and all is in a way of Receiving: will not this make us to fear the Lord then? The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> in the 5<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of <hi>Jer.</hi> 24. He wonders that the people ſhould not fear the Lord upon this ground: That the Lord gave them the <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer</hi> and the <hi>latter rain.</hi> And (ſaies he) <hi>they have not feared the Lord, that hath given them rain; the former &amp; the latter rain.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay thus: Theſe poor people they depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God for rain; and is it not a ſtrange thing that they ſhould not fear Him? Why, beloved, There is not one drop of Spiritual rain, or dew of Grace that fals upon the heart, but we live in dependance upon God for it; ſhall not this make us fear?</p>
                  <p>Again, beſides, <hi>Whatſoever ſervice you tender unto God on this ſide Heaven, it is all a waiting upon God.</hi> And therefore, the Saints that ſerve God, in Scripture they are ſaid to wait on God. (Mark I pray you) Our ſervice is a waiting upon God:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 40.31.</note> 
                     <hi>But thoſe that wait on the Lord, ſhal renew their ſtrength</hi> (ſaies <hi>Iſaiah.</hi>) Now if a man hear, that if he have no oyl in in his I amp, he is loſt for ever; and there is no way to get oyl, but by ſetting his veſſel under Gods Spout, and Gods Ordinance; will not this make a man to wait upon Him? Some there are that defer their Repentance, and they think to repent afterward, they think they ſhall be able to repent afterward: But now, when a ſoul ſhal hear, that all is in a way of Receiving; he muſt take it (therfore) when God does
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:170112:40"/>offer it; then he concludes thus: Is it ſo indeed, That al is in a way of <hi>Receiving?</hi> ſtrength to repent, 'tis by <hi>receiving?</hi> then wil I take while the Lord offers me ſtrength: Oh! I wil ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver defer my Repentance again, I wil now wait upon God, and now while the Lord offers, now I wil take it. Thus you ſee this Doctrine is afriend unto all endeavour: All is in a way of Receiving: no ſuch friend unto good endeavour as this Doctrine.</p>
                  <p>But you wil ſay unto me. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>

                     </label> That mercy may be ſure unto all His ſervants, which they would ſoon ſpend if it were in their own keeping (Mark I pray) There are theſe Two or Three Reaſons of Gods Proceeding this way, That all Grace ſhould be in a way of Receiving.</p>
                  <p>And the Firſt is: That all <hi>Boaſting, rejoycing,</hi>

                     <hi>confidence in ones ſelf may be taken away. If</hi> Abraham (ſaies <hi>Paul</hi> in the 4. of the <hi>Romans</hi>) <hi>were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, though not before God:</hi> He hath whereof to <hi>glory.</hi> But now, when all is in a way of Receiving, there's no room for <hi>Boaſting.</hi> Mark therefore what is ſaid, in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another? and what haſt thou that thou didſt not receive? Now if thou didſt receive it, why doeſt thou glory as if thou hadſt not received it.</hi> God cannot indure <hi>Boaſting,</hi> cannot indure <hi>Self-confidence,</hi> God cannot indure that a man ſhould glory in any thing in himſelf: therefore all, all is in a way of Receiving. This is Gods Reaſoning.</p>
                  <p>Again.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>2.</hi> Rea.</note> God hath ſo ordered things in the diſpenſations of His Grace under the Goſpel, <hi>That Jeſus Chriſt may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Honored, Exalted.</hi> No ſuch way to <hi>Honor</hi> Chriſt as this, that all ſhould come out of His hands, to be received from Him. Pray? Was it not a great <hi>Honor</hi> to <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the time of the famine in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that no bread, but ſhould come through his hands? not a corn of grain but ſhould come through his hands? So here: when no grace, no ſtrength, no aid, no aſſiſtance, no ſupplies; but all through the hand
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:170112:41"/>of Chriſt, all in a way of Receiving: does not this <hi>glorify</hi> Chriſt much? What is it, (I pray) that makes the Sun ſo <hi>glorious</hi> a creature, above all the creatures in the world; but this, That all the creatures depend upon him for light, and for warmth? This is that that makes the Lord Jeſus Chriſt <hi>glorious,</hi> That all muſt be in a way of Receiving from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>3.</hi> Rea.</note> God hath ſo ordered things in the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of His Grace under the Goſpel, <hi>That the Saints, and Children of God may live by faith.</hi> (Good people mark it.) Some there are, ſome creatures in the world, that do live by <hi>Sence:</hi> as the beaſts, and beaſtly men. Some creatures there are that do live by <hi>Reaſon,</hi> moral men: But the Lord would have His Children to live by <hi>Faith:</hi> That as the men of the world do live by <hi>Sence</hi> and <hi>Reaſon;</hi> So the Lord would have all His Children to live by <hi>Faith.</hi> What way, or means to bring a ſoul off for to live by <hi>Faith?</hi> Eſtabliſh this Doctrine, let this be a Statute made in the Churches, All in a way of <hi>Receiving:</hi> I, (ſaies a poor ſoul) is it ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed? What? all in a way of <hi>Receiving?</hi> Then I fee a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of living by <hi>Faith:</hi> Oh! Lord, teach me now for to live by <hi>Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee the Doctrine clearly proved by Reaſon to you. I ſhall not be able to reach the Uſe of the point, ſo as I intended.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine is exceeding Uſeful, ful of Spiritual Uſe: yet though I ſhall not be able to do what I would, give me leave for to make ſome Application of the point; and ſo I will winde up all.</p>
                  <p>Is this Doctrine true,<note place="margin">

                     <hi>That all, all is in a way of Receiving?</hi> Then behold what infinite care the great God of Heaven and Earth, hath of Beleevers, of every beleeving ſoul though he be never ſo mean! would you not think, that if a mother were ſo tender of her child, that ſhe would not let her child eat a bit of bread, but it ſhould be of her own cutting: that ſhe would not let it drink a drop of drink, but it ſhould be of her own drawing: would you not think
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:170112:41"/>this mother, this woman were very careful of her child? Beloved! thus the caſe ſtands: No Grace, no Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, no Help for duty, no Help againſt ſin; but the Lord Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf will have the cutting of it, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt will have the giving of it out; He will have the drawing of it all; all in a way of Receiving. Oh! what care! Oh! what infinite care hath God of poor Beleevers! When the Lord would commend His care of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> unto them; pray mark what an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument he uſes, in <hi>Deut.</hi> 11.10, 11, 12. <hi>For the Land whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goeſt in to poſſeſs it, is not as the Land of</hi> Egypt <hi>from whence ye came out, where thou ſowedſt thy ſeed, and wateredſt it with thy foot, as a garden of herbs.</hi> They fetch't water out of the River <hi>Nilus,</hi> and ſo they watered the Land of <hi>Egypt</hi> with their feet. <hi>But</hi> (ſaies he at the 11. verſe) <hi>the Land whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ye go to poſſeſs it, is a Land of hills and valleys, and drin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth water of the rain of Heaven:</hi> Not taken out of the River, and watered by mens feet, as <hi>Egypt</hi> was. <hi>A Land</hi> (ſaies the Lord) <hi>which the Lord thy God Careth for:</hi> A Land which the Lord thy God <hi>Careth</hi> for: He <hi>Cared</hi> not for <hi>Egypt.</hi> How does he prove that the Lord <hi>Cared</hi> for it? <hi>The eyes of the Lord thy God are alwaies on it, from the begining of the yeer, even unto the end of the yeer.</hi> He giveth rain from Heaven, and when your Land wants water, 'tis given from Heaven, 'tis not watered by mens feet, 'tis not watered as <hi>Egypt</hi> was wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, which Land God <hi>Cared</hi> not for. So now, there are ſome people in the world, that water themſelves, that go forth in their own ſtrength, that have moral vertues, and they water their hearts with their own feet, (as I may ſay) the Lord <hi>Cares</hi> not for thoſe, the Lord <hi>Cares</hi> not for ſuch. Oh! but give me a ſoul that hath rain from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, that lives in continual dependance, that acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges that all is Received, that lives upon Heaven; the Lord <hi>Cares</hi> for ſuch a ſoul. Now this is the condition of all the Saints, of every Beleever, he hath all in a way of Receiving: Oh! the infinite care that the Lord hath of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Beleever though he be never ſo mean.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:170112:42"/>
                  <p>Secondly.<note place="margin">Appli. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> Is this Doctrine true, <hi>All in a way of Receiving?</hi> Then behold! what ſweet, and comfortable, and pleaſant lives the Saints live, Beleevers have. When you look upon a Godly man, and conſider what great works he does, and what hard things he bears, what great Afflictions he goes thorow: You ſay, Good Lord! how is a man able to do, or bear all this? <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas</hi> 
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     </gap>nging in the ſtocks, when they were whipt and ſcourg'd, &amp; the blood running down their ſhoulders; and yet ſinging: How? how are they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do all, to bear all? To here, here is the reaſon: They have all in a way of <hi>Receiving.</hi> When you ſee the little Child run by the father in his hand, in a green meadow, you ſay, the Child hath a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ne, and a ſweet time: but when you ſee the Child coming at a high gate, or ſtile to get over, or dirty lane to paſſe over, now ye ſay, how will the Child do now? Why, ſurely the Child will do as well, and better now, if the father takes the child up in his arms, the dirty lane wil be the pleaſanteſt place to the child, when 'tis taken up into the fathers armes. Thus 'tis with the Saints great works they do, and hard things they go tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: Oh! but they are taken up into Chriſts Armes, and they have all in a way of <hi>Receiving.</hi> When you look upon a man that does keep a great Table, hath many ſervants attending on him; his Purſe alwaies full of money; you will ſay, ſurely, this man leads a fine, and a ſweet life if it do not coſt him much for to receive it, or get this money: but if you hear that he hath all his Eſtate, only for telling his money, his great pains is all in receiving his money: Oh! here's a bleſſed man indeed, and here's a happy man you think preſently! Thus 'tis; the great pains of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian is to Receive from Chriſt, and to ſpend for Chriſt. Oh! what a ſweet life does the Saints live, that live by Faith in Jeſus Chriſt?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly.<note place="margin">Appli. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> Is this Doctrine true? Then what abundance are there in the world, many that live under the Goſpel, that from hence are argued to have no ſaving intereſt in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt. (Good people mark it) that I ſay, are not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:170112:42"/>united to Jeſus Chriſt. There is a Two-fold <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> with Chriſt; as Chriſt is conſidered Two waies: He is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſidered with His <hi>Church,</hi> the Church and He ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king one body; and ſo all together are called, <hi>Chriſt:</hi> In 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. Or elſe He is conſidered as the great <hi>Mediator,</hi> and Savior of Beleevers by Himſelf. Accordingly men may be ſaid to be <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited</hi> to Him, Either <hi>Outwardly</hi> in the Church, tied and related to Him by outward Ordinances: Or elſe <hi>Inwardly</hi> united to Him by ſaving faith. When a man is <hi>Inwardly</hi> united to Jeſus Chriſt by ſaving faith; he hath all from Chriſt: Strength unto every duty from Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: <hi>Praying</hi> ſtrength, and <hi>Hearing</hi> ſtrength, and <hi>Repenting</hi> ſtrength, and <hi>Confirming</hi> ſtrength, he hath from Chriſt in a way of Receiving. But the other hath little, or nothing from Chriſt: (Pray mark it) I will expreſs it thus: A man takes a peice of bread, or a loaf of bread; he tyes it to his arm; his arm hath no ſtrength from that, 'tis but an outward tye to his arm, it hath no ſtrength from that: and it argues that 'tis but an outward tye, it cauſes no ſtrength by it. But if a man take bread, and eat it, that there be an inward union, then there is ſtrength, there is bread goes to all the parts: you know my meaning. Or thus; I will expreſſe it thus: Take a graft, and tye it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Tree, tye it unto a ſtock, and it brings forth no fruit at all; why? Becauſe 'tis but outwardly tyed unto the root, unto the ſtock of the Tree: But take the branch, and graft it into the Tree, into the ſtock; then it brings forth all that it brings forth by vertue of the ſtock that 'tis graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted into. So my beloved, there are a company, there are a generation of people that live here under the Goſpel, that are <hi>Outwardly</hi> tyed unto Chriſt: they are Baptized, they have the Name of Chriſt by profeſſion; and by the tye of the Ordinances, they are outwardly tyed unto Chriſt: but, Oh! they receive nothing from Him, nothing from Him: pray, what do they receive? Suppoſe Chriſt had not come into the world, ſuppoſe they had never heard Chriſt preacht; they might have lived <hi>Civilly;</hi> they might
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:170112:43"/>have lived <hi>Juſtly</hi> amongſt their neighbors: they might have abſtained from <hi>Lying,</hi> and <hi>Drunkenneſs:</hi> why, they do not thus much: poor creatures, nothing from Chriſt, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive nothing from Chriſt: Oh! theſe are but outwardly tyed, as a loaf of bread is tyed unto a mans arm; ſo is the Lord Jeſus in the Ordinances tyed unto them. I, but then, There are another people, that are <hi>Savingly</hi> united to Jeſus Chriſt: and theſe, they have ſtrength from Him; they cannot <hi>Pray</hi> but as they have ſtrength from Chriſt; they cannot <hi>Confer</hi> and ſpeak of good things, but as they have ſtrength from Chriſt, they cannot go and hear a <hi>Sermon</hi> with any affection, but as they have ſtrength from Chriſt: All, all in a way of <hi>Receiving:</hi> Oh! they ſtand in a way of dependance upon God, in Him, and they have all from Chriſt, theſe are <hi>Savingly</hi> united to Chriſt. But Oh! many that live among us that have not all from Chriſt: Certainly therefore, there are many that are not ſavingly united to Jeſus Chriſt. This is a Third.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Have made entrance upon theſe Words in ſome Neighbouring Congregations; in the hearing of divers of you: and my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire is to finiſh them here.</p>
                  <p>Having ſpoken of the former part of the verſe: <hi>And of His Fulneſs have al we received.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now unto the latter Clauſe; <hi>Even Grace for Grace.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The great Queſtion is upon theſe words; What ſhould be the meaning of them?</p>
                  <p>There are no leſſe then Seven, or Eight Interpretations that are given by men. I ſhal preſently tel you what I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend to be the meaning of them:</p>
                  <p>Three things, I conceive, may be ſpecially held forth in theſe words:</p>
                  <p>They may note, An <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> that the Saints in the New Teſtament, have from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſality</hi> of Grace.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/>
                  <p>And an <hi>Anſwerableneſs</hi> of Grace in every Chriſtian, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> unto the Graces of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I begin with the former at this time. They ſeem to note
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:170112:45"/>an <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace: <hi>Of His Fulneſs, all we have received, even Grace for Grace:</hi> that is, <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace.</p>
                  <p>This Interpretation, (that I might cleer up the meaning before I come to that which I intend to preſs) it ſutes with the like phraſe of Scripture,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job,</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>Skin for skin, and all that a man hath, will he give for his life:</hi> (you know the place.) That is, a man will give all his Skins, all his Cattell and Skins: (for their Eſtates in thoſe times did lie in Cattell much) he wil give al his Skins though they be never ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny; he will give them all for to ſave his life: <hi>Skin</hi> for <hi>Skin;</hi> though he have never ſo many: <hi>Skin</hi> for <hi>Skin, Abundance</hi> of Skins: <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace: <hi>Gratia gratiis accumelata.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This alſo ſutes with the word, <hi>And,</hi> or <hi>Even:</hi> 'tis not barely ſaid thus: And of His Fulnes have al we received Grace for Grace: but, of His Fulnes have al we received, <hi>Even Grace for Grace.</hi> That is, in great <hi>Abundance;</hi> we have not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived Grace, but we have received much Grace, <hi>Even Grace for Grace.</hi> This alſo ſutes, with the <hi>Title,</hi> the <hi>Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute</hi> that is here given to Chriſt; and that is; <hi>Fulneſs:</hi> When God, or Chriſt is mentioned in Scripture they are mentioned ſtill under ſuch a <hi>Title,</hi> as ſutes with the matter that is in hand: and you may know what the matter in hand is, by the <hi>Title.</hi> Now the <hi>Title</hi> here that is given to Chriſt, the <hi>Attribute</hi> that is given to Chriſt, is <hi>Fulneſs:</hi> Anſwerable unto that is, <hi>Fulneſs</hi> of Grace in us, or <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of Grace from Him. This alſo ſutes with the Scope of the place: for here the Evangeliſt ſets Chriſt above <hi>Moſes;</hi> ſhows how Chriſt does go beyond <hi>Moſes:</hi> the following verſe coming in as a reaſon of this: <hi>For the Law was given by</hi> Moſes,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John,</hi> 1.17, 18.</note> but <hi>Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt. No man hath ſeen God at any time; the only begotten Son which is in the boſom of the Father, He hath declared Him.</hi> You have much by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but you have more by Chriſt; you have <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of Grace by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This alſo is agreeable to other Scriptures, where the ſame matter is ſpoken of: If you look into the 5. of the
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:170112:45"/>
                     <hi>Romans,</hi> you ſhall find, that the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of the free gift of Grace, (at the 15. verſe) ſaies, That it hath <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded</hi> unto many: <hi>Much more the Grace of God, and the gift by Grace, which is by one man Jeſus Chriſt, hath abounded un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many.</hi> Would you have the word <hi>Received,</hi> joyn'd with <hi>Abundance?</hi> Look into the 17. verſe, and there you reade <hi>For if by one mans offence, death reigned by one; much more they which Receive Abundance of Grace, and of the gift of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall reign in life by one Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> All theſe things be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus laid together, they argue unto me; The main, and ſpecial thing that is here intended, is, an <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace: of whoſe Fulneſs we have all received, <hi>Even Grace for Grace:</hi> All the Saints and People of God under the new Teſtament, do receive Abundance of Grace from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Abundance of Grace <hi>Diſcovered.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Abundance of Grace <hi>Exhibited,</hi> and <hi>Communicated</hi> to all the Saints: he that hath the leaſt meaſure of Goſpel Grace, hath <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Abundance of Grace is now <hi>Diſcovered.</hi> That I may make that appear: Firſt.</p>
                  <p>It will appear, if you conſider the ſeveral <hi>Advances,</hi> that Grace hath made, from the beginning of the world to this day, upon the children of men. In the begining God made man perfect, and righteous, after His own Image: Man fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling from that Eſtate, expoſ'd himſelf, and all his poſteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the wrath of God for ever: Then Grace ſteps in, and makes it's firſt <hi>Advance</hi> into the world;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15.</note> 
                     <hi>The Seed of the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall break the ſerpents head.</hi> Here Chriſt is preach't, and preached to the greateſt ſinners; <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> that had damn'd all the world: And Jeſus Chriſt is preach't imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by God Himſelf. One would think now, that the Lord ſhould rather have ſaid to <hi>Adam: Adam,</hi> I made thee Perfect, and Righteous; thou might'ſt have kept thee ſo: thou would'ſt not truſt to Me, <hi>Adam;</hi> thou would'ſt truſt unto the Devil; Go now, now thou art fallen, go mend thy ſelf; if thou canſt find out a better Maſter, <hi>Adam.</hi> Or
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:170112:46"/>if the Lord would have ſhown mercy to <hi>Adam;</hi> one would think, that He ſhould have ſtaied for <hi>Adams</hi> Repentance; that <hi>Adam</hi> ſhould firſt a cried Him mercy: No, but before ever this poor prodigal ſtirs one ſtep unto his Father, his Father runs out to meet him, to overtake him: The Lord Chriſt is preacht, the Promiſe is propounded, the free Grace of God is revealed: Here was the firſt <hi>Advance</hi> that ever Grace made into the world.</p>
                  <p>But God who is rich in Grace, was not ſatisfied with this; but as in the fourth day, He does gather up all the light that was ſcattered abroad in the world before, into one body, <hi>The Sun:</hi> So now He does gather up all the beams of His Grace into one body, <hi>The Covenant</hi> which He does make with <hi>Abraham:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 12.3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. <hi>John,</hi> 56.</note> And unto <hi>Abraham</hi> He ſaies, <hi>In thy Seed ſhall all the Nations of the world be bleſſed. In thy Seed</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>He does not ſay Seeds; but Seed: meaning Chriſt. Abraham</hi> ſaw ſo much of Chriſt, that our Lord ſaies, <hi>He ſaw His day, and rejoyced in it.</hi> Here the Sun was gotten higher: For now, though Chriſt was preach't to <hi>Adam;</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was propounded: yet notwithſtanding, it was but barely propounded to <hi>Adam,</hi> it was not applied; And pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded in obſcure terms to <hi>Adam</hi> too: and rather given <hi>Threatning-wiſe</hi> againſt Satan; then <hi>Promiſe-wiſe</hi> concerning them. But now, the Lord does profeſſedly come and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply the Promiſe unto <hi>Abraham; And in thy Seed:</hi> which He does not give unto <hi>Abraham,</hi> as <hi>Abraham,</hi> as that <hi>Perſon;</hi> but as a <hi>Common</hi> Perſon for all Beleevers. Here was now a Second <hi>Advance</hi> that Grace made into the world.</p>
                  <p>But the Lord was not yet ſatisfied with this; but cauſes His Grace to <hi>Advance</hi> higher, in <hi>Moſes</hi> time: And unto <hi>Moſes</hi> He ſpeaks expreſly;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Deut.</hi> 18.15.</note> 
                     <hi>A Prophet will I raiſe up like unto thee;</hi> &amp; I'l put My Name in him: He ſhall be called, God, &amp; Jehovah as I am. Then the Lord proclaimed before <hi>Moſes,</hi> himſelf to be, the Lord, gracious, merciful, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, tranſgreſſion, and ſin, reſerving mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands. Then the Lord gave the <hi>Law:</hi> and leaſt they ſhould think, that God intended it as a Covenant of works; He
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:170112:46"/>did at the ſame time give the <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Law; that thereby they might reade the ſatisfaction of Jeſus Chriſt for any ſin they ſhould commit againſt the <hi>Moral Law.</hi> Here was a higher Advance.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe this was ſtill under-vail'd; And it is a pain to love to conceal it ſelf: the Lord does make a further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of His Grace, of Chriſt, by His ſervant <hi>David:</hi> for after <hi>David,</hi> and <hi>Solomons</hi> time, we reade of the <hi>Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal generation of Chriſt; Proverbs the</hi> 8.

(and divers other <hi>Pſalms</hi>) <hi>My God, My God, why haſt thou forſaken me.</hi> Of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt: in the 118. <hi>Pſalm;</hi> and the 16. <hi>Pſalm. Thou wilt not ſuffer thine holy One to ſee corruption.</hi> Of all the Three <hi>Offices</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt: His <hi>Kingly</hi> Office, The ſecond <hi>Pſalm, Yet will I ſet my King upon my holy Hill.</hi> His <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office, <hi>He ſhall declare the Decree, Pſal.</hi> 2.7.

                  <p>But the Lord was not yet contented, but cauſes more of His Grace to break forth in the times of the <hi>Prophets;</hi> more concerning Chriſt: He tells them of the very <hi>Time</hi> Chriſt ſhould be born, <hi>Daniel</hi> the 9.

Is there any more yet? Yes! our Savior Himſelf comes, and then Grace <hi>Advances</hi> higher, by much higher; then Grace enlarges her Quarters, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding it ſelf unto all the world, go teach all Nations: <hi>Go teach all Nations</hi> (ſaies our Savior.)

                  </p>
                  <p>Yea, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the ſecond place. Although our Savior Chriſt did go unto our fore fathers, the Jews; and preach unto them by His Spirit: He came to them as <hi>Joſeph</hi> to his bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren at the firſt, in a hidden way under a vail: But now the vail of the Temple is rent aſunder, and the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon people may ſee into the Holy of Holieſt; <hi>Now we all with open face, behold as in a glaſs the Glory of the Lord.</hi> The Jews,<note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> they had the <hi>Shadows:</hi> and we have, (as it were) the <hi>Picture:</hi> but the <hi>Subſtance,</hi> the <hi>Thing;</hi> it is yet to come. Theſe Three ye find in that firſt verſe of the 10. Chapter to the <hi>Hebrews. For the Law having a ſhadow of good things to come, and not the very Image of the thing.</hi> Here's the <hi>Shadow;</hi> and here's the <hi>Image;</hi> and here's the <hi>Thing</hi> it ſelf: The
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:170112:47"/>
                     <hi>Thing</hi> it ſelf, it is yet to come: They indeed had the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, but we have the Image: and look how much an I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, or the picture of a man goes beyond a ſhadow; So much does the diſcovery of Chriſt now, go beyond the diſcoveries of Him then. <hi>Luther</hi> ſaies, The whol world is but one day, (as it were.) And as the evening, and the morning made the day; ſo (ſaies he) our fore fathers the Jews, they had the evening, but we have the morning.</p>
                  <p>Again. Though there were many Doctrines of Grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and mercy communicated to our fore fathers the Jews: Yet notwithſtanding they were ſo tempered with the Law, that the very Goſpel ſeem'd to be Law to them: As now, we have the Law among us, but 'tis ſo temper'd with the Goſpel; that the Law it ſelf is Goſpel-wiſe to us. They had Chriſt in the hand of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and we have <hi>Moſes</hi> in the hand of Chriſt. A mighty difference! As we have a <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized,</hi> and a <hi>Chriſtian Moſes;</hi> ſo they had a <hi>Circumcized,</hi> and a <hi>Moſaical</hi> Chriſt. They had Grace in the hand of the Law. And therefore you ſhall obſerve, that when the Lord appear'd unto them in way of greateſt mercy, He appear'd ſtill with tokens of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs:</hi> But now we have Grace in the hand of <hi>Grace;</hi> we have Grace with the tokens of <hi>Grace,</hi> and with the tokens of <hi>Love.</hi> And this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference the Apoſtle makes out cleerly, in the 12. of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brews,</hi> from the 18. unto the 25.</p>
                  <p>Again, Though they had many Doctrins of Grace, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and of free Grace; yet themſelves were not made free thereby but they were as the children of the bond-woman; they were not free from <hi>Ceremonial</hi> Rites. They had the free uſe of the creature: their hearts were not free, and enlarged to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Indeed, thoſe that were Godly among them, they were Children:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.1, 4, 5, 6.</note> 
                     <hi>But</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks) <hi>they being under age, they differed not from ſervants ordinarily: But when the fulneſs of time was come, God ſent forth his Son, that we might receive the adoption of Sons: And the Spirit of Adoption whereby we cry, Abba, Father.</hi> They had the ſpirit of <hi>Bondage</hi> unto fear; and we have the Spirit of <hi>Adoption</hi> unto Love, to cry,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:170112:48"/>Abba, Father. They could not go to God, but with many <hi>fears:</hi> but there is none of all the Saints now, but go with a Spirit of <hi>Love,</hi> go to God as a Father: Every Saint now, may go to God and ſay, Father, Father, I labor under ſuch a temptation; Oh! Father, help me: I want ſuch a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, or mercy, Oh! Father give it me.</p>
                  <p>Again further, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> Although they had many ſprinklings of the Doctrins of Grace; yet they fell but <hi>droppingly</hi> upon them; now a drop, and then a drop: As you have it in the 1. <hi>Chap.</hi> of the <hi>Hebrews:</hi> 1. <hi>verſe, God who at ſundry times, and in divers manners, ſpake in times paſt unto the fathers by the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets; hath in theſe laſt dayes ſpoken unto us by His Son.</hi> God who by <hi>piece-meals,</hi> drop by drop; now a drop and then a drop, ſpake unto our fore-fathers by the Prophets; hath in theſe laſt times ſpoke unto us by His Son. This being the oppoſition, ſhews, that God ſpake perfectly, and ſpake al by His Son. When this King came, then all the Cocks run with wine. Some obſerve, that Jeſus Chriſt preached the Goſpel more plainly unto one poor, ignorant, ſinful, wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked woman, that ye reade of in the 4. of <hi>John;</hi> then He did unto al our fore-fathers under the Old Teſtament: for unto which of all our fore-fathers did He ſay, I am the Meſſiah, <hi>Ask of Me the water of life, and I will give it thee?</hi> You know the great Doctrins of the Goſpel, <hi>Juſtification by Grace: Free remiſſion of ſins;</hi> and the like: Now though theſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrins be in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> yet take your Book, and how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many leaves ſhal you reade over, before you be able to reade this Doctrine cleerly? But open your Book where you wil, open in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> and you ſhall meet with one eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie where; with this Doctrine, this great Doctrine of <hi>Free-Grace</hi> every where. Oh! much, much of Jeſus Chriſt, and of His Grace that is now <hi>Diſcovered;</hi> ſurely Abundance of Grace, Abundance of Grace <hi>Diſcovered</hi> to the Saints now, and to all the Saints.</p>
                  <p>But in the Second place. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> As there is Abundance of Grace <hi>Diſcovered:</hi> So there is Abundance of Grace <hi>Exhibited,</hi> and <hi>Communicated</hi> to all the Saints. Thoſe that have the leaſt
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:170112:48"/>meaſure of Grace now, have Abundance of Grace. That is the Thing that I would cleer up to you. That thoſe that have the leaſt meaſure of <hi>Goſpel-Grace,</hi> they receive Grace for Grace, they have abundance of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Is it not a great matter for an ungodly man to be <hi>Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> What man ſo godly, but he was ungodly before Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied?</p>

                     </label> Do you conſider, The <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of Grace: The <hi>Retinue</hi> of Grace: And the <hi>Myſiery</hi> of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> For the <hi>Oppoſition</hi> of Grace. A little Grace may be much oppoſed: and when the Oppoſition is great, though Grace be ſmall in the <hi>Bulk,</hi> it may be great in the <hi>Work:</hi> though little in the <hi>Quantity,</hi> yet it may be much in <hi>Quality.</hi> There's no true Goſpel-Grace, but it is much oppoſed. When Jeſus Chriſt came into the world, you know <hi>Herod</hi> raiſed all the County upon him: And ſo when Chriſt comes into the heart, the whol ſoul it is raiſed againſt Him, becauſe He comes as an enemy unto the ſoul. As when an enemy Lands, the Beacons are all fired, and the Country all riſes: what do you ſay? An enemy is lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, an enemy is landed, and all the Country riſes. So when Chriſt Lands upon a ſoule, at the firſt. He Lands as an enemy unto the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Then alſo comes in the power of all <hi>Relations;</hi> And the power of all <hi>Engagements:</hi> And the power of all <hi>former Cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms;</hi> And the power of an <hi>Evil Nature:</hi> Nay, if you will go this way to work, then farewel all <hi>Friends;</hi> and fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well all your former <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and farewel all <hi>Preferment.</hi> Was it not a great matter for <hi>Job</hi> to be upright in the Land of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>z?</hi> why? Becauſe there was much oppoſition in it. Is it not a great matter, for a little poor Barque, or Veſſel to live at Sea in the time of a ſtorm? for a little ſpark of fire to live in much water? for a little light to live in a great wind? You look upon ſuch a poor gracious ſoul, and you do not conſider the wind that blows upon it, the ſtorms that beat upon it; and you ſay, 'Tis not much Grace he hath, or much good he does: Oh! but conſider, if you would conſider the great <hi>Oppoſition</hi> that the ſoul meets withal, then you will ſay, Oh! 'tis much indeed, there is <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace there.</p>
                  <p>Secondly. Conſider the <hi>Retinue</hi> of Grace: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Grace hath a great Retinue, Though it be very mean, it hath rich Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue. If a man hath but a poor Cottage, an Acre of Land, an half-Acre of Land, a Rood: Yet if it be an <hi>Earneſt</hi> of a great <hi>Inheritance,</hi> 'tis much: Look upon the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Cottage in it ſelf, or the Rood of Land in it ſelf, 'tis not much; but conſider it as an Earneſt of a great Inheritance; ſo 'tis much. Beloved! whatſoever Grace the Saints have, they have it but as an <hi>Earneſt.</hi> Ye reade of the <hi>Teſtimony</hi> of the Spirit, of the <hi>Earneſt</hi> of the Spirit: all the Grace that the Saints have on this ſide Heaven, 'tis all but the Earneſt of what they ſhall have. And the Apoſtle, he bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes God for this, as ye reade in the 1. of the <hi>Coloſſians</hi> 12. <hi>Giving thanks unto the Father, which bath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light:</hi> (Mark,) Here are Three things eſpecially conſiderable in theſe words: All the Children of God have an <hi>Inheritance.</hi> You have but one <hi>Heir</hi> to your Eſtate, all are not Heirs; but all
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:170112:50"/>Gods Children have an <hi>Inheritance.</hi> And the Inheritance called, an Inheritance of <hi>Light:</hi> It does not lie in a dark, foggy, and fenny, and mooriſh place; 'tis a comfortable Inheritance, 'tis an Inheritance of light. And the Apoſtle, He does here give thanks unto God, that had made them <hi>Meet</hi> to be the partakers of the Inheritance of the Saints in light. He does not here give thanks unto God, for the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance; but that they were meet, to be partakers of the Inheritance; that they had an <hi>Earneſt,</hi> till the Inheritance came. (I ſay) all the Grace which a godly man hath on this ſide Heaven, it is but an Earneſt: you look upon it as it is in it ſelf, and you ſay; 'Tis not much: I but, look upon it as an Earneſt, but as an Earneſt, and then you will ſay, 'Tis much indeed, Oh! 'tis much indeed.</p>
                  <p>But then Thirdly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and ſpecially: Conſider the <hi>Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of Grace: Grace is a myſtery. Ye reade in Scripture of the myſtery of iniquity, and the myſtery of godlineſs: godlineſs is not only a myſtery in the general, but all the parts of godlineſs are myſterious; there is a myſtery in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part: and if you would but a little conſider the myſtery of Grace, I dare ſay, you would lift up your hands and ſay then, Oh! what <hi>Abundance</hi> of grace is here, even in the weakeſt Saint!</p>
                  <p>For example, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to Inſtance. Ye ſay, 'tis no great matter, for a man or woman <hi>to tremble at the Word:</hi> 'Tis more then many a one does; many come and fit out Sermons, &amp; never tremble before the Word. Well, but you ſay, 'tis no great matter to tremble before the Word, to tremble at the Word. I but, for a man to tremble at the Word, and yet to count it <hi>as hony, and the hony-comb</hi> to tremble at the Word, &amp; yet to <hi>love</hi> it, &amp; <hi>prize</hi> it then, &amp; look upon it as the hony and the hony-comb; this is much: Now ye ſhall have a poor ſoul, a poor Chriſtian, come and tremble before the Word, and yet look upon the Word as the hony, even as hony, and the hony-combe, for ſweetneſſe; This is much.</p>
                  <p>Again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> You count it no great matter, for one <hi>to love the
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:170112:50"/>Ordinances,</hi> ſo to love the Ordinances above all the world, as to be willing to part with all the world, rather than to part with them: This is a great matter. But may be, you will ſay, this is no great matter. Well, but for a man or a woman to think ſo; ſo to love the Ordinances, &amp; yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, at the ſame time to think that he don't <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit,</hi> that he is barren, and gets little or no good thereby; this is much. Now thus you ſhall have it with a poor Chriſtian; love, and prize the Ordinances, and would not part with the Ordinances for all the world, and yet at the ſame time complain, and ſay: Oh! I get little good thereby. Here's a Myſtery. Put all together; you take things aſunder, and therefore you think it is not much.</p>
                  <p>Again. You think it is no great matter for a man to comfort himſelf in this, <hi>That the Lord knows his heart.</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> I but, for a man to comfort himſelf in that, and yet ſay, <hi>There is much hypocriſy there;</hi> &amp; the ſame day, (it may be) ſay; Oh! I am an hypocrite. Thus you ſhall have it with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a poor, poor gracious, drooping ſoul. All is naught; Oh! my heart, it is full of hypocriſy; and I am but an hypocrite: and yet now, let him be charg'd or accuſed by men of the world, for ſuch and ſuch deſignes; he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts himſelf in this: Oh! but, bleſſed be the Lord, the Lord knows my heart. Put theſe things together.</p>
                  <p>Again, You wil ſay 'tis no great matter, for a man, <hi>To look into his own heart;</hi> ſo to look into his own heart, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> and ſo to be ſencible of his ſin, as to think he ſhall periſh for ever. I but, for the ſame perſon, To profeſſe he <hi>would not change his condition with another for all the world;</hi> this is much. Take many a poor drooping ſoul, and thus it is: I am afraid I ſhall go to Hell, and periſh to all eternity: But now, come &amp; lay his condition to a Drunkard, to an Adulterer; ſaies he, I profeſſe, I would not change my condition with that man for all the world, at the ſame time. Here's a myſtery! 'tis ſtrange; but there's a myſtery in every piece of godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and if you would but conſider, it would appear that there is much Grace in thoſe that have the leaſt.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:170112:51"/>
                  <p>Again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> You ſay 'tis no great matter, for a man <hi>To work out his ſalvation with fear, and trembling.</hi> I but, for the ſame perſon, <hi>To rely upon Jeſus Chriſt, only, for ſalvation;</hi> This is much. Now thus it is, you ſhall have a godly man work, work with fear, and trembling, as if he would earn Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven with his fingers-ends, and yet he relies upon Jeſus Chriſt only for his ſalvation.</p>
                  <p>Further. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> You ſay 'tis no great matter, for a man, <hi>To walk cloſely with God:</hi> But 'tis a great matter. It may be you wil ſay 'tis not. I but, for a man to walk cloſely with God, <hi>and yet to be in the dark:</hi> to walk exactly, and yet to be in a crowd, and throng of buſineſs; who can walk ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly in the dark? and who can walk exactly in a crowd, when he is carried to and fro in a crowd? Thus now, you ſhall have a godly, gracious man, walk exactly with God, cloſely with God; and yet may be in the dark; a Child of light, and yet in the dark; and in a crowd of occaſions and buſineſſe, and yet walk exactly: this is much.</p>
                  <p>Again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> You will ſay, 'tis no great matter <hi>for a man to be diligent in his particular Calling.</hi> I but, for the ſame perſon, <hi>for to take no thought, no dividing thought, what be ſhall eate, or drink, or put on;</hi> and yet be diligent in his particular Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: this is much. Now ſo it is, you ſhall have a godly, gracious ſoul, taking no care, no dividing care, what he ſhall eate, or drink, or what he ſhall put on; and yet dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in his particular Calling.</p>
                  <p>Again. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> You will ſay, It is no great matter, for a man, <hi>To grieve for ſin paſt, and to ſtrive againſt ſin for the time to come.</hi> I but, for the ſame perſon to know, that his ſin paſt is pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, and to know, that if he fall into a ſin for the time to come, God will work good out of it, it ſhal be for his gain, God wil over-rule it ſo; <hi>and yet ſtrive againſt it as the greateſt evil in the world:</hi> this is much. Now thus it is, A gracious ſoul knows his ſin is pardoned, yet he grieves for it: and he knows that if he ſhall fall into a ſin, the Lord will over-rule things ſo, as he ſhall be the better for it; and yet he ſtrives againſt his ſin, as the greateſt evil in the world. Here is a Maſtery! this is much.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:170112:51"/>
                  <p>Again. You will ſay 'tis no great matter, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="9"/> 
                     <hi>for a man to be quiet under his Affliction, becauſe it does come from God;</hi> for that reaſon: I but for the ſame perſon, <hi>To be the more ſenci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and to be the more afflicted, becauſe it does come from God;</hi> this is much. Beloved! you ſhal have theſe Two meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: A godly, gracious ſoul, he is therefore quiet under Affliction, becauſe it does come from God; and he is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the more ſencible of his affliction, becauſe it does come from God. Here's a myſtery! put theſe together, and you will ſay, things reſe high.</p>
                  <p>I'le Inſtance but in one more, and that is a Tenth. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="10"/> You will ſay 'tis no great matter, <hi>For a man to be contented with his condition:</hi> to be contented with his condition when 'tis mean, and when 'tis poor. I but, for the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>To deſire a better, and pray for a better, and to pray earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for a better; and yet be contented with his condition though it be never ſo mean;</hi> this is much. Thus 'tis with the Saints, a Child of God, being in a mean condition, he deſires a better; he prayes to God for a better, and he prayes ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly to God for a better; and yet he is contented with his condition though it be never ſo mean: pray, and pray earneſtly, and yet contented with his condition, though it be never ſo mean, Thus, my Beloved; Oh! there is a <hi>Myſtery,</hi> there is a myſtery in every piece of godlineſs: and you look not upon things under the myſterious Notion, and you ſay; 'Tis no great matter, that is in the life of ſuch a one: Oh! but, if you would look upon things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this Notion, and conſider the myſtery of godlineſs, and every piece thereof you would lift up your hands, and ſay; Oh! ſurely, he that hath but the leaſt meaſure of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Grace, hath <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace: he that hath but the leaſt degree of Grace, hath <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace; of Chriſts Fulneſs. Now under the new Teſtament we have received not <hi>Sparingly,</hi> not <hi>Scantly:</hi> but <hi>Grace for Grace,</hi> and <hi>Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance</hi> of Grace: he that hath but the leaſt meaſure, hath received much, hath received <hi>Abundance,</hi>

                  <pb n="86" facs="tcp:170112:52"/>
                  <p>Some few things by way of Application, and ſo I have done.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſo;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Applic.</hi> 1</note> Then why ſhould any of Gods People vilifie, and degrade, and lowen the gift of God wherewithal they are enriched through Jeſus Chriſt? Would you take it as fair dealing from a child that is eſtated in great lands by his father; if he ſhould ſay, my father indeed was pleaſed to beſtow a great Eſtate upon my Brother; but he hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven little, or nothing to me? He hath beſtowed great means upon ſuch a Siſter, but he hath given little or nothing to me? This were not fair dealing. And is this fair dealing with your God, and with your father? When you ſhall ſay, I, there is ſuch a godly man, the Lord hath given him a great Eſtate of the Goſpel, but little or nothing to me: And there is ſuch a woman, ſuch a Siſter; the Lord hath done much for her ſoul; but Oh! little or nothing for me. Beloved! There is no ſin ſmall, becauſe committed againſt the great God; There's no bleſſing ſmall, becauſe received from the great God: but of all bleſſings, Goſpel-bleſſing is the greateſt bleſſing. Hath the Lord therefore, (man or woman) given thee any Goſpel-Grace, the Grace of Jeſus Chriſt? He hath given thee <hi>much:</hi> that which thou look'ſt upon as little, 'tis much in the eye of Heaven. Wherefore now, let not the Eunuch ſay; Oh! let not the Eunuch ſay; I am a dry tree any longer. Take heed how you degrade, and vilifie, and lowen the Grace of God wherewithal you are inrich't through Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Appli.</hi> 2.</note> If there be ſuch Abundance of Grace, even Grace for Grace; Abundance of Grace given unto the Saints, and People of God under the new Teſtament: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold then, what great finners Profeſſors are! yea, the fins of Gods own people. The more light, and knowledge a man hath; if he ſin, the greater is his ſin: The more beams of Grace fall upon a mans heart, the more he is able to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the motes that are there, and ſo may avoid them: and
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:170112:52"/>ſinning, he ſins the more. The more grace, and the more mercy a man ſins againſt, the greater is his ſin; becauſe free Grace, and mercy is the remedy. The more ſtrength a man hath to ſtand, the greater is his ſin if he fall: As it was with <hi>Adam,</hi> He had ſtrength to ſtand, and yet he fell. (I ſay) the more ſtrength a man hath to ſtand, the greater is his ſin if he fall. Now Beloved! ye have heard what A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Grace is Diſcovered, Exhibited, Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated unto all the Saints under the new Teſtament; unto all the People of God: Oh! how great are their ſins when they fall! The Lord was quick with many that ſinned in the old Teſtament: and will He not be quick with Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors now? that know more, that have more Grace, more Grace Diſcovered now? Many, when they ſin, they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe themſelves and they ſay, True indeed, I have thus and thus ſinned; but <hi>David</hi> did ſo: I have ſinned, I have done thus and thus; but <hi>Sampſon</hi> did ſo: I have committed this, or that ſin; but <hi>Noah</hi> did ſo.

I have done, only this, Here is alſo incouragement unto all that are godly, and therefore they ſhould labor to be rich in Grace. ſhall Jeſus Chriſt do much for you? and will you do little for Him? ſhall you receive Abundance from Him? and will you not do Abundance for Him? La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, Oh! labor all you Servants of God to Abound in the Work of the Lord; That you may be fil'd with all the Fulneſs of God in Chriſt; That you may be fil'd with all the fruits of righteouſneſs; That you may be ſtrengthened with all might in the inner-man: you have received much, you have had Abundance; he that hath the leaſt Grace, hath Abundance: if thou haſt but the leaſt Goſpel-Grace, thou haſt Abundance. Brethren! Grace hath Abounded! Oh! let us Aboundin <hi>Grace,</hi> Aboundin <hi>Faith,</hi> and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bound in <hi>Patience,</hi> and Abound in <hi>Meekneſs, Sweetneſs,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> towards one another, and towards all the Saints.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>E heard the laſt day, that three things were contained in this laſt Clauſe, <hi>Even Grace for Grace;</hi> as it ſtands in relation to the former part of the verſe.</p>
                  <p>Firſt of all, It notes an <hi>Abundance</hi> of Grace: <hi>Even Grace for Grace;</hi> that is, <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance</hi> of Grace. The Saints and Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God under the new Teſtament, do receive Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Grace from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It notes alſo thus much: <hi>That all Grace is from Jeſus Chriſt. That whatſoever Grace the Saints have, they have it from Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Grace for Grace (ſaies <hi>Auſtin</hi>) that is, Grace in order to Grace: God gives the former Grace (ſaies he) to prepare for the after Grace. Whether the former, or the latter rain; whether the former or the latter Grace, 'tis all from Chriſt. whatſoever Grace the Saints have, they have it from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This ſutes with the phraſe of <hi>Job</hi> ſtill: <hi>Skin for skin,</hi> that is, all a mans skins. So 'tis explain'd by the following words: <hi>Skin for skin,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Job,</hi> 2.4.</note> 
                     <hi>even all that a man hath will he give for his life.</hi> So here, <hi>Of His Fulneſs have all we received, Even Grace for Grace:</hi> that is all Grace: Whatſoever Grace we have, we have it from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>And this alſo ſutes with the Scope of the place: the ſcope of the place is, to exalt Jeſus Chriſt above them that came
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:170112:55"/>before Him, above <hi>Moſes</hi> Therefore ſaies he at the next verſe,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh</hi> 1.17</note> 
                     <hi>For the Law was given by</hi> Moſes, <hi>but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Though the <hi>Law</hi> were given by <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> yet notwithſtanding, <hi>Grace,</hi> (the chief) that is from Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now Grace, The word <hi>Grace</hi> here in the 17. verſe, muſt be underſtood of <hi>All</hi> Crace. The Law was given by <hi>Moſes,</hi> but Grace and Truth: that is, <hi>All</hi> Grace: And this verſe being brought in as a reaſon of the former; ſurely there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, this muſt needs be the meaning alſo of the former, That all grace is from Jeſus Chriſt; whatſoever Grace the Saints have, they have it from Jeſus Chriſt. This is the Argument that I intend (God willing) to ſpeak unto at this time.</p>
                  <p>Grace, Sometimes is taken for the <hi>Favour</hi> of God. Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is taken for <hi>Gods Aſſiſtance.</hi> Sometimes it is taken for <hi>Holineſs,</hi> either in the <hi>habit,</hi> or in the <hi>act.</hi> Sometimes it is taken for <hi>gifts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Sometimes the word <hi>Grace,</hi> is uſed for an <hi>Office</hi> in the Church. Whatſoever it be, which way ſoever you take it; <hi>All</hi> Grace is from Chriſt: whatſoever grace the Saints have, they have it from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>This now will appear, if you conſider, The <hi>Inſufficiency of Nature:</hi> And the <hi>All-ſufficiency of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Inſufficiency of Nature;</hi> You know what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſaies:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5.</note> 
                     <hi>Wee are not able as of our ſelves, to think a good thought, but all our ſufficiency is of God.</hi> And if you look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this firſt Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> you find, That thoſe that are regenerate, and borne again; 'tis ſaid concerning them (at the 13. verſe) that they are not borne of <hi>Bloods</hi> (in the plural number) your Engliſh hath it, <hi>Blood,</hi> (in the ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar) <hi>You are not born of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, but of God.</hi> Some there are, and were, that thought themſelves to be the children of God, becauſe they came of godly parents, becauſe of their <hi>bloods,</hi> becauſe of their <hi>education:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Ioh.</hi> 8.33</note> So the Jews, <hi>Wee are the Children of</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham. Some there are, and were, that think themſelves the Children of God, becauſe of ſome <hi>Legal workings,</hi> and
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:170112:55"/>
                     <hi>monkiſh devotion:</hi> all thoſe legalities under the Goſpel, are called, <hi>fleſh.</hi> Some there are that think themſelves the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, becauſe of ſome more <hi>refined,</hi> and <hi>raiſed,</hi> and <hi>heroical</hi> actions. That he might obviate all theſe; ſaies he, <hi>We are not born of bloods, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the wil of man, but of God.</hi> You are for <hi>Free-will,</hi> and you think Free-will hath a great ſtroke in mans Converſion: but how can ye look this Scripture in the face? No way of <hi>will,</hi> not of the will of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> nor of the will of <hi>man.</hi> If it be any <hi>will,</hi> it muſt be either the will of the <hi>fleſh,</hi> or the wil of <hi>man:</hi> but I tel you (ſaies he) We are not borne of blood, nor of the will of the fleſh, nor of the will of man, (no way of will) but of God.</p>
                  <p>To the like purpoſe you have in <hi>James,</hi> 1.17. <hi>Every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above.</hi> In ſome of your books you reade thus: <hi>Every good gift, and every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect gift is from above:</hi> But it is rather to be read, <hi>Every good giving.</hi> Every good gift, and every good giving is from above. Not only the <hi>Thing</hi> given, is from above, but the very <hi>Donation,</hi> the very <hi>Exhibition,</hi> the very <hi>Giving</hi> out of the thing that is good, it is from above. Every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above. So that plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then, there is an utter Inſufficiency in Nature unto what is good.</p>
                  <p>As for the <hi>Al-ſufficiency of Jeſu Chriſt:</hi>

The firſt is the cauſe of the reſt. The Sun is the firſt, and the great light, ſo the cauſe of all other light. Jeſus Chriſt, He is called the firſt, in this ſame Chapter, 15. verſe <hi>This was He</hi> (ſaies <hi>John</hi>) <hi>of whom I ſpake, He that cometh after me, is preferred before me, for He was before me.</hi> So ye reade it, but it is <hi>He was my firſt,</hi> preferred before me,<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>I am the <hi>Way.</hi> Would you go to Heaven? You cannot
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:170112:56"/>go thither, but you muſt go in ſome <hi>Way:</hi> A man cannot go unto a City, but he muſt go ſome way or other; if he go by water, go by land, this way, or that way; ſtill he goes ſome <hi>Way</hi> or other. Saies Chriſt if you would go to Heaven, I am the <hi>Way.</hi> This ſame word, <hi>Way,</hi> it notes the means unto a thing: and when He ſaies, <hi>I am the way,</hi> 'tis as if He ſhould ſay, That look what ever means you do uſe in order to Heaven, all thoſe means they have their vertue, and their power, and their efficacy from me.</p>
                  <p>I but, a man may be in a way, and in a right way; and yet notwithſtanding, if he have not ſome guide, he may loſe his way.</p>
                  <p>True (ſaies He) therefore I am the <hi>Truth:</hi> and 'tis obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vable, how <hi>Truth,</hi> lies between <hi>Way,</hi> &amp; <hi>Life:</hi> as if the way to <hi>Life</hi> were thorough <hi>Truth,</hi> as if Truth were the great road, or the thorough-fare to life: ſaies Jeſus Chriſt, I am that too; I am the Way, and the <hi>Truth</hi> too.</p>
                  <p>I but, though a man be in the right Way, and have a guide; he may fall ſick, and die, and never come to his journeyes end.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſaies Chriſt, I am the way, and the Truth, and the <hi>Life</hi> too. I, even I am He, that gives life unto all your motions, and actions for Heaven; all Grace from Chriſt. He it is, even He alone, that hath every mans heart, and ſoul under lock and key.</p>
                  <p>There are Three great doors, that muſt ordinarily be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, before converting-Grace can get into the ſoul of man:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.9. <hi>Job,</hi> 33.16. <hi>Acts.</hi> 16.14 <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7</note> The door of a <hi>Powerful Miniſtry: A large, and an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual door is opened.</hi> The door of <hi>the Eare: He openeth the eare, and ſealeth inſtruction.</hi> The door of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> and of the heart: Lydias <hi>heart was opened.</hi> Now if you look into the Scripture you will find, that Jeſus Chriſt hath the opening of all theſe doors. <hi>He hath the key of</hi> Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, <hi>He openeth and no man ſhuts, and ſhutteth and no man ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth.</hi> in the 1. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> and the 18. He ſaies, <hi>That He hath the keyes of Hell, and of death.</hi> No man goes into the grave, but He opens a door to let him in: and no man
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:170112:56"/>goes to Hell, but Jeſus Chriſt He locks him up there, He locks him up there unto all eternity; if He did not lock him in, he would not be there unto all eternity. So that whatſoever Grace, or holineſs there is in any mans heart, He opens the door, He lets it in, 'tis by His ordering and His ſending thither.</p>
                  <p>And Beloved, if Jeſus Chriſt were not the great Lord-Keeper of His Fathers wardrobe; why ſhould thoſe <hi>Names,</hi> and <hi>Titles</hi> be given to Him, which you find ſo frequently in Scripture? Caſt your eyes where you wil, you ſhal hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly look upon any thing, but Jeſus Chriſt hath taken the Name of that upon Himſelf.

If you look upon the <hi>Stones:</hi> He is called, <hi>A corner Stone.</hi> If you look upon the <hi>Trees:</hi> He is called, <hi>A Tree of life.</hi> What is the reaſon of this? Surely, not only to <hi>way-lay</hi> your thoughts, that whereſoever you look, ſtill you ſhould think of Chriſt: But to ſhew, that in a Spiritual way, and ſence, He is all this unto the ſoul. And you may obſerve, that theſe <hi>Titles,</hi> and <hi>Names,</hi> they are not barely, and nakedly given to Him; but ſtill with ſome ſpeciality, ſome mark or other. He is not barely called the <hi>Shepheard;</hi> but the <hi>good</hi> Shepheard.

And therfore as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the 3. <hi>Col.</hi> 11. you reade it, <hi>Chriſt is all in all:</hi> but better, <hi>He is all things, in all perſons:</hi> or all <hi>things,</hi>

So now, when a man conſiders Chriſt, as this great Sun of righteouſneſs, diſtributing His Graces to all the Saints; will it be any diſhonor to God the Father that He is in this Office, ſeeing He hath furniſhed Him hereunto? Surely no, they will-rather lift up their hands and ſay, Oh! what a good God have we, that hath fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed Chriſt with all theſe abilities for our poor ſouls?</p>

<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170112:59"/>that all is of God, that all is of Grace; and ſo this place does rather confirm the Doctrine that I am now upon.</p>

                  <p>For although in the beginning God made a Covenant of works with man, and then gave that Grace, that he had a power to bring forth it's like: Yet now the Lord, hath brought us under a better Covenant, a better Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant than the former was.

                  <p>And ſhall wee honor our parents becauſe we have our outward <hi>being</hi> from them? and ſhall not we honor Jeſus Chriſt, from whom we have the <hi>being</hi> of all our Graces, the <hi>being</hi> of our ſouls unto all Eternity?

Beloved! you may obſerve That when the Lord commanded His People in the old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament to honor Him, He commands them to ſacrifice ſuch things to Him, which other Nations did make their Gods: they ſhould ſacrifice ſheep, and oxen, and birds; ſuch things they ſhould offer up unto God, that others did worſhip as God: Plainly teaching this, That he that will honor God, muſt give that unto God which the world makes it's God. So ſay I, if you would honor Chriſt, you mſt give that up unto Jeſus Chriſt, which other men do make their Chriſt. Many falſe Chriſts there are that are made by men: you cannot honor Jeſus Chriſt, if you don't give up thoſe to Him.</p>
                  <p>Again. You cannot honor Jeſs Chriſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>If you count it a ſmall matter to belong to him.</hi> A ſervant that honours his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, does count it a great matter to belong to Him.

                  <p>Fourthly. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Ye cannot honor Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>And deſpiſe the choice work of Chriſt.</hi> What is the <hi>choice work</hi> of Chriſt?

<pb n="109" facs="tcp:170112:63"/>to God, he beleeved above hope, and under hope; and becauſe he beleeved above hope, and under hope, therefore he gave glory to God, when he conſidered his own body. Man or woman, wouldſt thou therefore now honor Jeſus Chriſt? Say, True, I confeſs indeed I Have finned much; and when I look, upon my ſelf, I know no reaſon why ſuch a wretch, ſo great a finner as I ſhould be ſaved: but becauſe the way to honor Chriſt, is for to reſt upon Him; and I have diſhonored Jeſus Chriſt enough already, therefore now, through the Grace of God, I will caſt the waight of my poor, guilty ſoul upon Jeſus Chriſt; yea, for that ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry reaſon will I leave the waight of my guilty ſoul upon Him, becauſe thereby I may honor Him.</p>

                  <p>I but though a man have Abundance of Grace, and be Abundant in the work of the Lord; yet notwithſtanding, if he be not <hi>Conſtant</hi> therein, he does not cauſe the way of Chriſt to be well ſpoken of: what will men ſay?

                  <p>Yea, though a man be Abundant; and Conſtant: yet if he be not <hi>Humble,</hi> he does not honor the way of Chriſt:

                     <hi>The Lord Jeſus Chriſt is our ſecond</hi> Adam, <hi>a Common perſon between God and us.</hi> Now look as it was concerning our fore-father <hi>Adam,</hi> being a Common perſon; look what nature he had, we have: He was made up of <hi>ſoul</hi> and <hi>body;</hi> and ſo are we, His body had <hi>legs,</hi> and <hi>arms,</hi> and other <hi>members;</hi> and we have <hi>member</hi> for <hi>member;</hi> we have <hi>head</hi> for <hi>head,</hi> and <hi>arms</hi> for <hi>arms,</hi> and <hi>legs</hi> for <hi>legs:</hi> And ſo, he ſinning, we have <hi>ſin</hi> for his <hi>ſin, pride</hi> for his <hi>pride,</hi> and <hi>unbelief</hi> for his <hi>unbelief;</hi> becauſe he was a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon perſon.

                     <hi>bleſſed love between Chriſt and a Chriſtian.</hi> Love, loves to make a thing loved to be like it ſelf. Love in an <hi>Inferiour</hi> is of an
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:170112:68"/>Imitating Nature: and love in a <hi>Superiour</hi> is of a Similita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Nature. Now therefore, if there be love between Chriſt and a Chriſtian, they muſt needs be very like; and love there is: Chriſt loves the Saints above all the world; and the Saints love Chriſt above all the world. Only Chriſts love exceeds: for when the Spouſe ſpeaks of Chriſt in the <hi>Canticles,</hi> ſhe cals Him, <hi>My beloved,</hi> in the <hi>Concrete:</hi> but when He ſpeaks of her, He cals her <hi>my love my dove,</hi> in the <hi>Abſtract.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt had loving thoughts towards the Saints before the world was: as ye reade in the 8. of the <hi>Proverbs,</hi> and the 29. verſe. Saies wiſdom, (and ſo Chriſt) there: <hi>When He gave to the Sea His Decree, that the waters ſhould not paſs His Commandement: when He appointed the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of the earth: Then I was by Him, as one brought up with Him: I was daily His delight</hi> (verſe the 31.) <hi>Rejoycing in the habitable part of His earth: and my delights were with the ſons of men.</hi> Jeſus Chriſt was then in the boſom of His Father, He had enough to take up His heart with full delight; and yet notwithſtanding, before the Saints were, His love was towards them, and His delight was in them: Surely, if He loved them ſo much before they had a being, when they have a being, He will exerciſe, and put forth that old, and ancient love of His in more abundance, towards them. When a man loves a Maid, or a Virgin: while ſhe is in her fathers houſe, ſhe is ſet a part for him: but now afterward, when ſhe leaves her fathers houſe, and all her kindred, that ſhe may only cleave unto him; then his heart is drawn out more: How am I ingaged (ſaies he) to love this wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, that hath left all the world to come unto me. So there was love in Chriſt towards the Saints while they were but ſet a part for Him in Gods <hi>Decree:</hi> but now when they ſhall leave their fathers houſe for Him, will He not then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them? See what is ſaid in the 45. <hi>Pſalm: Hearken, O daughter,</hi> (at the 10. verſe) <hi>and conſider, and incline thine ear: forget alſo thine own people, and thy fathers houſe: So ſhall the King greatly deſire,</hi> (or delight) <hi>in thy beauty.</hi> But de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in them, and love them he cannot; unleſs they be
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:170112:68"/>like unto him: for the lover loves to make a thing loved to be like himſelf, or himſelf to be like to it: The lover would (if he could) melt himſelf into a <hi>One-neſs</hi> with the thing lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Indeed our love is ſcant, and we cannot do it. <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,</hi> (of whom the Law is ſignified) might chip, and pare his wives nailes, but he could not change her countenance. A man may love his wife, and beſtow much upon her; but he is not able to change her countenance, to make her to be like himſelf: But Jeſus Chriſt hath this happineſs above all the world; His love hath this happineſs above all other love, that He is able to melt the perſon loved, the ſoul lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved into His own likeneſs: and therefore, wherever Jeſus Chriſt ſets His heart upon any ſoul, to delight in any; He draws His Image upon them, makes the ſoul to be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Him: what Grace He hath Himſelf, He does communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate it unto that ſoul, that there is an <hi>Anſwerableneſs</hi> of Grace, Even Grace for Grace.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>There is the ſame Spirit in a Chriſtian,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rea.</hi> 4. <hi>Joh.</hi> 15 26.</note> 
                     <hi>that is in Chriſt. I will ſend</hi> (ſaies He) <hi>the Comforter, the Spirit of truth, and He ſhall come unto you.</hi> The Spirit does not only come to them; but is ſaid to dwel in them, and to be ſhed abroad upon their hearts. Now if a <hi>Beaſt</hi> had the ſpirit, and the ſoul of a man; he would <hi>work</hi> like a man, he would <hi>ſpeak</hi> like a man: and if a <hi>Plant,</hi> if a <hi>Tree,</hi> if an <hi>Herb</hi> had the life of a Beaſt; it would <hi>taſt</hi> like a Beaſt: And if a <hi>Stone,</hi> if that had the life of a Plant, it would <hi>grow</hi> like a Plant. So now, if a Chriſtian have the Spirit of Chriſt, he muſt <hi>work</hi> like Chriſt, he muſt needs be like Chriſt: Now the ſame Spirit He hath, a Chriſtian hath the ſame Spirit with Chriſt, and therefore needs muſt be like unto Him, and have Grace for His Grace.

Beloved! here's glory on this ſide glory; 'tis the glory, and the honor of a man to be like to God: 'tis the glory, and honor of a Diſciple to be like his Maſter: 'tis the glory, and honor of a Child to be like his father: 'tis the glory, and honor of a Chriſtian to be like unto Jeſus Chriſt: Every Chriſtian, hath the Image
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:170112:71"/>of Chriſt drawn upon him. Had our Lord Ieſus, the Great, &amp; Mighty Potentate, only come <hi>by</hi> a poor ſoul, and caſt His Skirt over him, and ſaid unto the ſoul, wear thou my Livery: it had bin a great honor to belong to Chriſt, to wear His Livery: But behold! here's more than ſo, the Saints do not only wear His Livery, but they have His Grace: and their Grace is of the ſame nature with the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Grace of Chriſt; as our Grace ſhould a bin of the ſame nature with <hi>Adams,</hi> if <hi>Adam</hi> had ſtood. Yea, not only their Grace is of the ſame nature; but look what Grace Chriſt had, they have Anſwerable to it. Had this great and royal Loadſtone, that draws all mens hearts after him; only touch't our hearts that we might have followed him; what a Mercy had it bin! But behold! here is more than ſo: the Saints they have Grace for Grace; whatſoever Grace, or holineſs there is in Chriſt, ſomewhat in a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Anſwerable thereunto. Oh! Dignity! Oh! Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty! how can a Chriſtian but be welcome to God the Father, that does not come only in the Name of Chriſt to Him; but brings the Image of Chriſt too with him, Grace for Grace. Oh! who would not be Incouraged to get in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Jeſus Chriſt? Oh! you that are in Chriſt, do you know what priviledges you walk under every day? You, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, are ready to envy at the men of the world: but I pray, Would you now change your condition with them? Such a one, he hath <hi>paſſion</hi> for <hi>paſſion;</hi> and <hi>pride</hi> for <hi>pride;</hi> and <hi>ſin</hi> for <hi>ſin</hi> with the world: and you have, <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace</hi> with Jeſus Chriſt. Here's Dignity! here's Priviledge indeed!</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay; <label type="milestone">

                     </label> you cannot be <hi>proud</hi> of it, for then you ſhal not be like to Chriſt; Who though He thought it no robbery to be equal with God the Father; He humbled Himſelf, &amp; became of no reputation. Beloved, you know that all Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170112:71"/>lents are to be improved; and the greater the Talent, the more improvement is to be made; and improvement is to be made of the ſame kind. 'Tis our wiſedom to obſerve what work God is a doing upon our ſouls, and to help forward that work. If God be working <hi>Faith</hi> in our hearts, it is our duty to help forward the work of <hi>Beleeving.</hi> If God be working <hi>Patience</hi> in our hearts, 'tis our duty to help forward the work of <hi>Patience.</hi> Look now, what work that is, that God is doing in our hearts, and lives for us; that work we are bound to help forward: Now hath (therfore) God drawn the Image of Jeſus Chriſt upon your hearts, ſo that there is an habitual likeneſs in your ſouls unto Jeſus Chriſt? Then it is your duty to labor for an actual like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; to be like unto Him in all your working; to live as He lived; and to do as He did; and to ſpeak as He ſpake: labor more and more to be like unto Him in your lives.</p>
                  <p>And if you ſay, How ſhould that be? The Apoſtle tells you: <hi>Whom beholding, as in a glaſs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18.</note> 
                     <hi>we are changed from glory to glory, according to His own Image:</hi> The ſerious, frequent beholding of Jeſus Chriſt, is the only way to be like unto Him Beloved! your lives, they are divided into two parts: There is a <hi>Doing part:</hi> and a <hi>Suffering part:</hi> As Chriſts O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience was divided into <hi>Active,</hi> and <hi>Paſſive</hi> Obedience. Would you in the Doing part of your life be like unto Chriſt? Behold Him in His Doing: <hi>Omnis Chriſti Actio, est inſtructio.</hi> Every Action of Chriſt may be our inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Nothing in Chriſt not imitable; ſome things more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially. For Example: Our Lord and Savior Chriſt, He made it His great buſineſs and deſign, To bear witneſs to the Truth: <hi>For this Cauſe came I into the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>Again, He would ſtoop to any work, though it lay much below Him: waſn His Diſciples feet: lay His <hi>Excellencies,</hi> at the feet of their <hi>Infirmities.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, When He went upon any work, He was much in <hi>Prayer</hi> firſt. <hi>Judas</hi> knew His Praying place.</p>
                  <p>And when He was at Gods work, He would not know
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170112:72"/>His own <hi>Natural Relations:</hi> And therefore ſaies He to His Mother, <hi>Moman, My time is not yet come:</hi> He does not ſay, <hi>Mother,</hi>

                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.4.</note> My time is not yet come: but <hi>Woman.</hi> in Gods Work, He would not know His owne Naturall Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons.</p>
                  <p>If He had to deal with man: He had a high eſteem of the Saints though they were never ſo low: And He had a low eſteem of the wicked, though they were never ſo rich.</p>
                  <p>He did (again) ſo exerciſe one Grace, as He might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe another.

                  <p>He was a <hi>Lamb,</hi> and a <hi>Lyon:</hi> a Lamb in his own Cauſe; and a Lyon in Gods Cauſe. Oh! that in theſe thigns you would labor to be like unto Him.

                  <p>And ſo for His <hi>Sufferings.</hi> Ye ſhall obſerve, He would not ſuffer till He was called unto it. Therefore He ſtood ſo preciſely upon His Time:<note place="margin">

Oh! my beloved, that you would labor now, for to be like unto Jeſus Chriſt; in your <hi>Doing:</hi> in your <hi>Suffering</hi> for to be like to Him.

                     </note> That the Saints, and People of God, do receive of Chriſts Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Even Grace for Grace: How infinitly are we bound unto God the Father, for our Lord Jeſus Chriſt! glorious is the fellowſhip, and communion that the Saints have with Chriſt, (as ye heard) they have not only fellowſhip with Him in His ſufferings, to have ſuffering for ſuffering: but they have fellowſhip with Him in His <hi>Graces,</hi> Grace for Grace: and this fellowſhip hath God the Father brought you into. Mark therefore, that place again which you have in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9 <hi>God is faithful, by whom ye were called unto the fellowſhip of His Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> By whom ye were called unto this fellowſhip. Therefore ſtill
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170112:73"/>the Apoſtle, he bleſſes God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt: <hi>Bleſſed be God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Not barely, Bleſſed be God, but, Bleſſed be God, the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Beloved! Ye know there are Two great <hi>Gifts,</hi> that the Scripture makes mention of. Firſt God makes the world, and Man: and having made man, He gives all the world to man: there's one <hi>Gift,</hi> and a great Gift. Man having fallen, and loſt his former Happineſs; Chriſt comes into the world, the ſecond Perſon becomes man; and this man he gives unto the world.</p>
                  <p>Firſt He gave the world to man: And Secondly, He gives Chriſt, this man, unto the world: and His ſecond <hi>Gift</hi> is the greater <hi>Gift:</hi> it's a greater Gift when Jeſus Chriſt was given unto the world, than that the whol world was given to man. For now, take the world; and though it hath many glorious pieces of Gods workmanſhip; His Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and Wiſedom: yet God may give all the world to man, and not give him Himſelf: but when He gives Jeſus Chriſt to man, He gives Himſelf with Him. Though there be many ſeveral pieces, beautiful pieces of Gods workmanſhip in the world; yet they carry with them but the <hi>Footſteps of God:</hi> Oh! but Jeſus Chriſt He is the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Image of the Father; and when He gives this expreſs Image unto a ſoul; as Chriſt is the expreſs Image of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, ſo the ſoul becomes the expreſs Image of Jeſus Chriſt. Ye know what the Apoſtle ſaies, concerning our Savior Chriſt:<note place="margin">

<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170112:73"/>Chriſt: Of his Fulneſs have we received, Grace for Grace: As the Fulneſs of God the Father dwels in Him <hi>bodily,</hi> ſo the Fulneſs of Chriſt dwels in every Chriſtian <hi>Spiritually.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this fellwoſhip hath God the Father called you un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>By whom we have fellowſhip:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9</note> this hath God the Father called you unto. Oh! how infinitly are you bound unto God the Father, to honor, and bleſs the Father! When ye look upon the Son, me thinks you ſhould bleſs the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and when ye look upon the Pather, you ſhould love the Son. As a mother does; when ſhe looks upon her Child, ſhe loves the father; and when ſhe looks upon the fatehr, ſhe loves the Child again: So a Chriſtian, when he looks upon Jeſus Chriſt, he ſhould bleſs the Father; and when he looks upon the Father, he ſhould bleſs Jeſus Chriſt, and love Jeſus Chriſt: Dear Father, thou haſt not only given us thy Son, but given us thy Son in ſuch a way, that we ſhould have Grace for Grace, <hi>Anſwerable</hi> to His Grace: is this after the manner of men? Oh! therefore, why ſhould we not all ſay, Bleſſed be God, and the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Oh! you, you that love Jeſus Chriſt, bleſs the Father: and you that bleſs the Father, love Jeſus Chriſt: take your ſelves to be infinitly bound unto god the Father, who hath given you ſuch a Chriſt as this, of whom you ſhould have Grace for Grace.</p>
                  <p>I have done. Only I would leave one Exhortation whith the Saints, that have received of Chriſts fulneſs thus, Grace for Grace: It's thus, mark it I pray.</p>
                  <p>Is this true, That of His Fulneſs ye have all received,<note place="margin">Appli. <hi>4.</hi>
                     </note> Grace for Grace, Anſwerableneſs of Grace? that ye have fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt in all His Graces? Then be for ever contented to have fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt in al his <hi>Sufferings.</hi> And truly, well may ye be contented, if you have fellowſhip with Chriſt in His <hi>Sufferings;</hi> if you have <hi>Suffering,</hi> for <hi>Suffering,</hi> ye ſhall have <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace,</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> for <hi>Glory;</hi> if ye partake with Him in His Sufferings, ye ſhall partake with Him in His Graces, and partake with
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170112:74"/>Him in His Glory. I ſay, well may ye be contented to have fellowſhip with Him in His Sufferings, for if you have ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for ſuffering, you ſhall have Comfort for Comfort: if you have fellowſhip with Him in His ſufferings: you ſhal have fellowſhip with Him in His Comforts too. (Mark ye) When Jeſus Chriſt Suffered, Had He a Deity to ſupport Him? So ſhall you have. When Jeſus Chriſt Suffered, Had He Angels to miniſter to Him? So ſhal you have. When Jeſus Chriſt ſuffered, Did He ſee the travaile of His Soul? So ſhall you ſee it. When Jeſus Chriſt was lift up, He drew al men after Him: So ſhal you do: when you are lift up for the Truth upon the croſs; you are apt to think, now wil the Truth ſuffer, now wil the Cauſe of God fall to the ground: But remember, if you have fellowſhip in His Graces; if you have fellowſhip with Chriſt in His Sufferings; you ſhal have fellowſhip with Chriſt in His Comforts: This was one of His Comforts; when He was lift up upon the Croſs, then He drew all men after Him: So, when you come to be lift up upon the Croſs, then ſhall men be drawn after the Truths that you ſuffer for: and never ſhal men be more drawn after the Truths that you ſuffer for, then when you come to be lift up upon the Croſs to ſuffer for them. Oh! who would not be willing to partake with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt in His ſufferings, to have fellowſhip with Him in his ſufferings, to have ſuffering for ſuffering? 'Tis obſerved, that our Savior never met with any great dobaſement, but at that time, in the midſt of that debaſement, there was ſome breakings forth of Golory. He was born in a Stable, He was laid in a Manger; here was His firſt debaſement: Here glory breaks forth; the Wiſe men come and fal down before Him, and offer gifts; frankincenſe, and mirrhe.</p>
                  <p>Again, He was Baptized: He needed not to have been Baptized; He was clean enough in his Nature, He put our cloathes upon him, ſtood in our nature: Now, He hears a Voice from Heaven,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matt.</hi> 3.17</note> ſaying, <hi>This is My Beloved Son.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, You reade of Him riding upon an Aſs: Not ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding in a Coach drawn with Lyons, and drawn with Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170112:74"/>Savior, riding upon an Aſs, in a mean way, a debaſed way; now breaks forth ſome glory, now they cry, <hi>Hoſanna, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanna</hi> to him.</p>
                  <p>Again, upon the Croſs, there he was moſt debaſed; then breaks forth ſome glory: The Sun, that ſtands ſtill, and vails his face, as one aſtoniſhed at the worlds Savior: Now does the vail of the Temple rend in ſunder, now Glory breaks forth in the midſt of his debaſement; Thus it was with Chriſt. Have you ſuffering with him for ſufferings? Have you fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings? you ſhall have fellowſhip with Chriſt in his Comforts. Oh! therefore I beſeech you be contented now to have ſuffering for ſuffering with Jeſus Chriſt; and whenſoever any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering comes, eſpecially for the Truth, boggle not at it, be content, and ſay within your ſelves, Oh! bleſſed be the Lord, that hath called me out to this work! I ſhall have this fellowſhip with Chriſt in his ſufferings, I ſhall now have ſuffering for ſuffering, therefore I ſhall have Comfort for Comfort, I ſhall have Grace for Grace, I ſhall have Glory for Glory: Oh! who would not be encouraged? I leave this Exhortation with you, comfort your ſelves in theſe words, and never ſtartle at ſuffering, as herefore; but make account of this, That if you have <hi>Grace</hi> for <hi>Grace,</hi> ye may meet with <hi>Suffering</hi> for <hi>Suffering;</hi> but then you ſhall have <hi>Comfort</hi> for <hi>Comfort,</hi> and ye ſhall have <hi>Glory</hi> for <hi>Glory.</hi> Think on theſe things, and the Lord give us to practiſe them.</p>

                  <p>Some anſwer it thus, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> That the Apoſtle here ſpeakes of the firſt giving out of the promiſe unto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> which we read of in the 12. of Geneſis; but that cannot be, he was not then an hundred years old; <hi>He conſidered not his own body now dead when he was about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years old,</hi> and ſo t'is ſaid, <hi>he was an hundred years old</hi> in the 17.

                  <p>Others, they anſwer it thus, That <hi>Abraham</hi> hideed at the firſt did conſider his owne body, and did doubt through un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe: but afterwards <hi>Abraham</hi> recollected himſelf, and got over that unbeliefe; but the Apoſtle he ſpeakes the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in the 20. verſe, <hi>He ſtaggered not at the promiſe through unbeliefe.</hi>

                  <p>Others, they anſwer it, by labouring to ſind out ſome my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall interpretation of thoſe words, <hi>Shall a child be brone unto him that is an hundred years old? and ſhall Sarah that is ninety years old beare?</hi> as if <hi>Abraham</hi> (ſay they) had ſaid thus, Lord, thou haſt ſome ſecret meaning in theſe words, I pray thee ſpeak it out unto me, and tell me plainly thy meaning; and therefore, (ſay they) God anſwered to that purpoſe in the 19. verſe, <hi>And God ſaid, Sarah thy wife ſhall beare thee a ſon indeed.</hi> I meane according to my words, <hi>Sarah</hi> ſhall beare thee a Son indeed.</p>
                  <p>But we need not ſtraine for any myſticall interpretation, or expreſſion: when <hi>Abraham</hi> ſayes, <hi>Shall a child be bron un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him that is an hundred years old?</hi> (In that ſeventeenth of <hi>Geneſis</hi> and the ſeventeenth) they are words not of <hi>Doubting,</hi> but words of <hi>Inquiring: Abraham</hi> deſiring to be further ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, and rightly to underſtand the meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and rightly underſtanding the meaning of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, ſayes the Apoſtle, He did not much mind, he did not throughly mind, he did not ſtand poring upon, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the deadneſſe of his own body, or the deadneſſe of <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe.</p>
                  <p>There are three things (eſpecially) conſiderable in theſe words.</p>
                  <p>Friſt of all, That <hi>Abrahams</hi> body and <hi>Sarahs</hi> body are dead, after God gives out a promiſe of a great ſeed of his.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That notwithſtanding this, yet <hi>Abraham</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeved &amp; is commended for it, <hi>He being not weak in the faith, conſidered not his own body being now dead.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thirdly, That in all this he had an eye unto Jeſus Chriſt, as I ſhall ſhew you afterward; Accordingly I would take up three obſervations thus.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>When God intends to fulfill his promiſe by giving any ſpeciall bleſſing to the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>he does firſt of all put the ſentence of death upon the bleſſing, and upon all the means that do lead unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That then, and then eſpecially it is the duty
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170112:77"/>of all the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>to truſt in God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And thirdly, <hi>That no difficulty can ſtand before faith; true, ſaving, juſtifying faith carries the ſoule through all difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, diſcouragements, and naturall impoſſibilities to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>A promiſe of a great ſeed like the ſtarres of heaven, and the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore, is given to <hi>Abraham;</hi> but before it is fulfilled, <hi>Abrahams</hi> body is dead, and <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe dead; the ſentence of death put upon the mercy, and the means that do lead unto it; and herein <hi>Abraham</hi> is held forth for our example, it was written not for his ſake alone, (at the 23. verſe) but for us alſo, to whom it ſhall be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted (at the 24. verſe) And as thus it fell out with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> ſo it falls out with all the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> with all beleevers, when God intends to give any ſpeciall or great mercy by fulfilling his promiſe, he does firſt of all write down the ſentence of death upon the mercy, and upon the means that do tend unto it.</p>

                  <p>Hereby God is known to to be a <hi>living God:</hi> ſo long as there is life in the meanes, God is not ſo well known to be a living God: but when all meanes are dead, and yet the mercy comes, Oh! ſayes a ſoule, now I ſee that God is a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving God.</p>

                  <p>And then againe ſecondly, God does go this way with his people, with beleevers, the children of <hi>Abraham, That they may learne more to truſt unto him, to truſt unto God alone:</hi> You know what the Apoſtle ſayes in the firſt of <hi>Timothy</hi> the fifth chapter and firth verſe, <hi>She that is a widdow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolate truſteth in God.</hi> We ſeldome truſt in God, till a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation come upon the meanes: A widdow that is deſolate, truſteth in God; when deſolation comes upon the meanes, then we learne for to truſt in God. One that does learne to ſwimme, ſo long as he can touch the bottome, can touch the earth with his foote, he does not commit himſelfe unto the ſtreame: but when he can feele no bottome, then he commits himſelfe unto the mercy of the waters: Now ſo long as a man can ſtand upon the ſecond cauſe, he can feele the bottom with his feete, he does not commit himſelfe to the ſtreame of mercy: but when once the ſecond cauſe is gone, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not feele the bottome; then he commits himſelfe unto the ſtreame of mercy. And you ſhall ſee the Apoſtle gives you this account of it, in the ſecond of <hi>Corinths,</hi> the firſt chapter, and the ninth verſe, <hi>But we had the ſentence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God, which raiſeth the dead.</hi> This is another reaſon, why God is pleaſed to go this way.</p>

Love loves to be like unto Jeſus Chriſt: and Faith loves to go in the garment of Jeſus Chriſt: as with him, ſo with the Saints.</p>
                  <p>And then againe fourthly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Reaſ. </seg>4</label> God is pleaſed thus to order things in the diſpenſations of his grace, and mercy, <hi>That the comforts of his people may be the more ſure, and ſtedfaſt.</hi> If our comforts hang at the girdle of the creature, they are moſt uncertaine: but if they be laid up in God, in his promiſe, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his power; then they are certaine. He that is engag'd in the crowd, muſt be carried too and fro in the crowd: And he that is in a ſhip, muſt be carryed as the ſhip is. If a man ſtand upon a banke of Ice, he is apt to ſlide; but if he ſtand upon dry ground, he ſtands more ſure: All the ſecond cauſes, they make but a banke of Ice; and when a man ſtnads on them; and his comforts on them he is apt to ſlide: the only dry ground
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170112:79"/>is Gods <hi>power,</hi> and Gods <hi>faithfulneſſe,</hi> and his <hi>promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That a mans comforts therefore may not ſlide, but may be more ſure, and ſtedfaſt; God takes this courſe with his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, putting a ſentence of death upon the mercy, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it, before he gives it out unto the ſoule.</p>

                     </label> This ſhakes the very foundation of all my comfort: for it this be true. That when God intends any ſpeciall mercy to the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he does firſt put the ſentence of death upon it, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it: then ſurely, I am none of the children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> I never had any ſkpeciall mercy yet given unto me; I do not find that it hath been ſo with me.</p>

Some would have the Sunne ſet by their watch, and not their watch ſet by the Sunne: ſome meaſure the truth of all the doctrines that they heare by their owne experience, and if their owne experience ſpeake them true, then they are true; otherwiſe not, But I ſay, what then? It may be thou art a man, or woman, that the Lord never gave out a promiſe to thee, not a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe to thy ſoule: ſome there are in prayer, that by the ſtrength of their memory can reach in a promiſe; and when Art, and memory reaches in a promiſe into prayer, the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death, does not then paſſe indeed: but when the Lord gives out a promiſe to the ſoule, then the ſentence of death paſſes upon the buſineſſe, upon the mercy, and upon the meanes that do lead unto it. I appeal unto all the Saints here: Whether ever had ye any great mercy in all your life; but firſt of all, there was a ſentence of death paſt upon it, and upon all the meanes that did lead unto it? And therefore, thought thou ſaieſt, this ſhakes the foundation of thy com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, truely, better a rotten foundation ſhould be ſhaken, then ſtand.</p>

<pb n="161" facs="tcp:170112:80"/>mercies.</hi> We reade of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he had other children, it was not ſo in regard of them, but <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the great bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; it was ſo in regard of <hi>Iſaac.</hi> The children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they had their daily bread, and their water; their daily proviſions, we do not find it in regard of them: but they had <hi>Manna</hi> from heaven, and they had water out of the <hi>Rock,</hi> they had ſpeciall water, ſpeciall bread, ſo in regard of theſe. And therefore if you look into <hi>Exod.</hi> 15. you ſhall find there at the laſt verſe. <hi>They came to Elim, where were twelve Wels of water,</hi> (according to the twelve Tribes, every Tribe had twelve) <hi>and threeſcore and ten palm trees,</hi> (according to the number of thoſe that went down to <hi>Egypt,</hi>)But now before they had theſe twelve Wels of water, yea reade at the 22. verſe, <hi>that they went three dayes in the wilderneſſe, and found no water,</hi> at the 25. verſe, you reade of waters they had that were very ſweet: but before that, the water was bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it was called <hi>Marah, And when they came to</hi> Marah, <hi>they could not drink of the waters of</hi> Marah, <hi>for they were bitter: therefore the name of it was called</hi> Marah. <hi>And the people murmured againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>ſaying, what ſhall we drinke? and he cried unto the Lord, and the Lord ſhewed him a tree, which when he had caſt into the waters, the waters were made ſweet.</hi> The ſpeciall waters and bleſſings of Gods people come to them thus.</p>
                  <p>Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the ſentence of death may be put upon your mercy <hi>in another mans hand.</hi> It was a great mercy, even to <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> that by him all the Nations of the world ſhould be bleſt; but the ſentence of death was put upon this mercy in <hi>Abrahams</hi> hand, as well as in his owne; Thou comeſt it may be to the preaching of the word, and thou art conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch a ſermon; thou doeſt not ſee how the ſentence of death was put upon this mercy before thou hadſt it: may be the ſentence of death was put upon it in the <hi>Miniſters</hi> hand, in the <hi>Preachers</hi> hand, may be he had laid aſide thoſe <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Truths,</hi> and thought to preach upon ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther matter; may be the ſentence of death was put upon thy mercy in his hand: ſo ſometimes it is in another mans hand.</p>
                  <pb n="162" facs="tcp:170112:81"/>
                  <p>Againe, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> though the ſentence of death be put upon a mercy, before a beleever comes to it; <hi>yet it is much accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the life of the mercy that is afterward.</hi> If the life be great, the death is great, If the life be ſmall the death is ſmall. And ſometimes the ſentence of death falls <hi>moſtly</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the apprehenſion: as it was with <hi>Hagar;</hi> ſhe was in the wilderneſſe, and ſhe thought ſhe ſhould die for want of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: only (ſaid ſhe) I won't ſee my child die, and there was a <hi>Well</hi> by. So that now, here the ſentence of death lay <hi>moſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> upon her own apprehenſion. And thus you have it alſo with <hi>Joſhua</hi> of whom you reade in the firſt of <hi>Ioſhua;</hi> the Lord makes him a great promiſe: <hi>now therefore ariſe,</hi> (ſayes he at the ſecond verſe) <hi>go over this</hi> Iordan, <hi>thou and all this people; every place the ſole of your foot ſhall tread upon; that have I given unto you.</hi> And at the latter and of the fift verſe. <hi>I will be with thee, I will never leave thee nor forſake thee.</hi> Now if you look into the ſeventh Chapter, you find <hi>that Joſhua had rent his clothes</hi> (in the ſixt verſe) <hi>and fell to the earth upon his face, before the arke of the Lord, untill even-tide, and</hi> Ioſhua <hi>ſaid alas, O Lord God, wherefore haſt thou at all brought this people over Iordan, to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to deſtroy us? would to God we had been content, and dwelt on the other ſide</hi> Jordan, why? whats the matter? you read <hi>there went up</hi> 3 <hi>thouſand men of the Iſraelites, and thirty ſix men of them were ſmote by the men of</hi> Ai. Here was cauſe now of fear, but no cauſe of ſuch expreſſions as did fall from <hi>Ioſhua:</hi> a ſentence of death paſſes upon the mercy, but it lay <hi>moſtly</hi> upon the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of <hi>Ioſhua.</hi> Sometimes it fals more upon the <hi>appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion,</hi> and leſſe upon the <hi>thing,</hi> ſometimes it fals more upon the <hi>thing,</hi> and leſſe upon the <hi>apprehenſion:</hi> but alwayes more or leſſe, when God intends any great or ſpeciall mercy to his people, to the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> he does firſt cauſe the ſentence of death to paſſe upon it, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay then, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> why does God give the promiſe? I confeſſe this is true, I ſeldome had any great mercy in all my dayes, but firſt of all, the ſentence of death came upon
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:170112:81"/>it: But one thing ſeemes very ſtrange to me; that the Lord ſhould give out a promiſe, firſt a promiſe given out, and then comes the ſentence of death upon the mercy, and upon the meanes that do lead unto it. What ſhould be the meaning of this? why does the Lord deal thus, give out a promiſe firſt?</p>
                  <p>A promiſe is given out twice. At the firſt, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> before we do uſe the meanes, to incourage us thereunto. Afterwards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſome incouragements that we do meet with in the uſe of means.</p>
                  <p>When the Lord does firſt give out the promiſe, a ſentence of death then paſſes, that he may ſhew you where the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy lies. As the mother does deale by her child; ſhowes the child where the meat ſtands: child, thou art not yet fit for it, thou ſhalt have it in due time, look, here it ſtands. Or as a father that ſhowes the child where the money lies: child, time is not yet, but there the money lies, ther's the bag it's in, none ſhall take it from thee. So does God do: you thinke that the Mercy lies in the ſecond cauſe; No, ſayes God, here, here's the bag that it lies in. Therefore he does firſt give out the promiſe, that he may tell the ſoule where the Mercy lies, ſhow the ſoule where it is.</p>
                  <p>And then againe. <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>2</label> God does therefore give out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, notwithſtanding the ſentence of death; becauſe he intends not to give the Mercy preſently. You think it may be, that aſſoone as you have a promiſe ſet on upon your heart, you ſhall preſently injoy the Mercy: Nay, but God does therefore give you a promiſe, becauſe you ſhall not have it preſently.</p>
                  <p>As for Example: If I would pay a man my money down pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently, I would not give him a bond: but my very giving him a bond, argues, I am not to pay him preſently. So the Lord, he gives out a promiſe, and you thinke now, you muſt have it preſently: No, (ſayes the Lord) but becauſe a ſentence of death is to come, and thou ſhalt not have it preſently; therefore I give out the promiſe.</p>
                  <p>And againe thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>3</label> God does therefore give out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe notwithſtanding his ſentence of death: that your hearts
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:170112:82"/>may be borne up againſt all diſcouragements, when the wombe of the ſecond Cauſe ſhall be dead. God ſees that his child, or ſervant, is going to a great ſtorme: ther's ſuch a child of mine (ſayes God) he is going into a great ſtorme, and his Faith will be put to a great ſtreſſe; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I will furniſh him with <hi>Cables,</hi> and good <hi>Anchors;</hi> I'le throw him out a promiſe. You thinke, becauſe God gives you a promiſe, becauſe God gives you Cables, becauſe God gives you Anchors, therefore you ſhall come to land pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently: the Lord does therefore give you a promiſe, becauſe he does ſee that a ſtorme is coming: you miſtake the way of God in his promiſe, this is Gods way, he gives out a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and then cauſes the ſentence of death to paſſe upon the buſineſſe, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it.</p>
                  <p>I come unto the Application.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I ſtand upon this truth,<note place="margin">Applicat.</note> me thinkes I ſee matter of great, and everlaſting incouragement to all the Saints and people of God: be not diſcouraged, but rather keep ſilence, waite, and ſtay upon God when the darkeſt times go over your head; when the ſentence of death is put upon the Mercy, and bleſſing which you do moſt deſire. This is Gods way, when he intends any great Mercy to any of his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he puts a ſentence of death firſt upon it. Oh! when death ſits upon the meanes,<note place="margin">Pſal. 116.11.</note> then we conclude all's dead, the Mercy dead, all's gone; and we are very apt to have deſpairing thoughts, and to make deſpondent concluſions. <hi>I ſaid in my haſt</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>all men are liars: Samuel</hi> ſayes, I ſhall have a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; the ſentence of death is put upon the buſineſſe; <hi>All men are liars.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 31.22.</note> So in another place: <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, I am caſt out of thy ſight:</hi> ſhall I ſee the face of God? nothing but death upon all the means;<note place="margin">Iſai. 38.11.</note> I am caſt out of thy ſight. So with <hi>Hezckiah, I ſaid</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>I ſhall be caſt out of the Land of the living.</hi> And ſo now adayes: I thought indeed that we ſhould have had a <hi>Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation;</hi> but now nothing but ſad <hi>Diviſion:</hi> I thought we ſhould have had free enjoyment of al the <hi>Ordinances:</hi> but now the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death put upon all. I had thought I ſhould have had <hi>Aſſurance,</hi> and never <hi>doubted</hi> again; but now death put upon it,
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:170112:82"/>and upon all the means that do lead unto it: all's dead, all's gone: Oh! we are very apt to be much diſcouraged, &amp; to make ſtrange concluſions when death comes upon the meanes: 'tis a hard thing to keep from ſuch concluſions: For the buſineſſe comes to a Vote (as it were) it comes to a Vote before the Soule. The queſtion is (ſayth the Soule) whether I ſhall be ſaved or no? As many as are for the Affirmative, ſay, <hi>I:</hi> I, ſayes the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> As many as are for the Negative, ſay, <hi>No:</hi> No, ſayes <hi>Threatnings;</hi> and, No, ſayes <hi>guilty Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience;</hi> No, no, no, ſayes a thouſand <hi>ſinnes.</hi> The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is, whether I ſhall be <hi>delivered</hi> or no? I am in ſuch an <hi>Alliction,</hi> and ſtraitneſſe; the queſtion is whether I ſhall be delivered or no? As many as are for the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> ſay, I: I, ſayes the <hi>Promiſe.</hi> As many as are for the <hi>Negative</hi> ſay, No: No, ſayes <hi>Providence;</hi> No, ſay all <hi>ſecond Cauſes,</hi> and all the meanes round about; No, no, no, ſay a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>ſinnes.</hi> Now my beloved, its a hard thing for a poor Soule to give an Affirmative with the bare Promiſe, when all elſe gives a Negative: but the reaſon is, becauſe this truth that now I am upon, is not by you; were but this truth by you, it were eaſy to give an Affirmative with the bare Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, when death ſits upon all the meanes. As for example: Suppoſe our Army by in the field, engaged with the enemy; a Troupe routed, a Regiment routed, a Wing routed; Come, (ſayes a carnall Souldier) fellow Souldiers, ſhift for your lives, for we are all undone and ſpoil'd: Nay, not ſo, ſtay (ſayes the beleeving Souldier) this is Gods way; when God intends any great Mercy to his people, he does firſt of all put the ſentence of death upon it, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it: and therefore, come, fall on, fall on, brave hearts, fall on; for this is Gods way: ans ſo it proves many times.</p>
                  <p>Or ſuppoſe a man be in ſome perſonall <hi>ſtraite</hi> or <hi>affliction:</hi> the Devill, the Tempter he comes; ye ſee in what ſtraite ye are; ther's no meanes at all for your deliverance, you had as good take ſuch and ſuch an indirect courſe; why ſhould you waite any longer? Nay, ſayes the Soule, but I have
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:170112:83"/>learned otherwiſe: when God intends any great Marcy to his children, he does firſt of all put the ſentence of death upon it, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it: and therefore I will waite on God ſtill, I may be in Gods way, this may be Gods way; it may be the Lord is in a way to give me a greater Mercy then ever I had in all my dayes. Oh! my Beloved, that you would but gird this truth upon your thigh, how might you cutt off all diſcouragements as they riſe upon you.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> How does this cutt off diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? ſome things there are that die, and never riſe again, as <hi>Beaſts:</hi> ſome things there are that die, and do riſe again, as <hi>Men:</hi> The ſentence of death is upon the Mercy that I do much deſire; and did I know indeed, that it ſhould riſe again, it were a matter of great Incouragement to me, but that I do not know.</p>
                  <p>For Anſwer, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>
                     </label> I ſhall onely ſay thus much to it: A <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy, is a ſufficient ground for our reliance and ſupport of the Soule upon God. Marke, there is two acts of Faith; the Faith of <hi>Reliance,</hi> and the Faith of <hi>Aſſurance;</hi> Aſſurance, that cauſes <hi>Joy;</hi> Reliance that cauſes <hi>Quietneſſe:</hi> Accordingly there are two Objects of Faith; A <hi>ſhall be</hi> of Mercy, that is the Object of Aſſurance; A <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy, that is the Object of Reliance. Ye ſhall obſerve therefore, that when the Lord would call out his people to an act of Reliance upon him, he holds out a <hi>may be</hi> of mercy to them:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Zeph.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
                     <hi>Seeke the Lord, ye meeke of the earth; ſeeke righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſſe, ſeeke meekneſſe; it may be ye ſhall be hid in the day of the Lords anger;</hi> ye know the place in <hi>Zephaniah:</hi> And if you looke into the 1 <hi>Samuell</hi> the 14. Chapter, ye ſhall find, that this <hi>may be</hi> was that encouraged <hi>Jonathan</hi> (at the 6. verſe) Jonathan <hi>ſaid to the Young man that born his Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour: Come, and let us go over unto the garriſon of theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed: it may be that the Lord will worke for us; for there is no reſtraint with the Lord to ſave by many, or by few. It may be the Lord will work for us, for there is no reſtraint with the Lord, to ſave by many or by few.</hi> This encouraged <hi>Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than,</hi>
                     <pb n="167" facs="tcp:170112:83"/>and hereby he incourages his Armour-bearer. So, when a man can ſay thus: it <hi>may be</hi> the Lord will ſhow Mercy to me in ſuch a work, or in ſuch a buſineſſe; there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint with him; it cauſes the Soule to rely on God. Now this Doctrine, it holds forth a <hi>may be</hi> to you, a <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy to you; though you have not an Aſſurance that this mercy that hath the ſentence of death upon it, will certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly riſe againe; yet notwithſtanding, ſeeing it is Gods way, this is Gods way with the Children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> when he intends to give a ſpeciall Mercy, he does put a ſentence of death upon it. This holds forth a <hi>may be</hi> unto you, a <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy this Doctrine holds forth unto you. Why therefore (my beloved) ſhould we not relie upon God, when the ſentence of death is put upon the meanes, upon all the meanes that does lead unto the Mercy that you moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire?</p>
                  <p>But you will ſay unto me; Is there no way, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Queſt. </seg>
                     </label> no meanes to ſpy out Gods meaning in this particular? Oh! that I did but know, whether this Mercy that hath the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon it, ſhall riſe again: how ſhall one know that? are there no meanes to know it? whether a Mercy ſhall riſe againe, when the ſentence of death is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it?</p>
                  <p>I ſhall ſpeake but two things unto that, briefly.</p>
                  <p>A Chriſtian may have ſome perſwaſion of the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of his Mercy when the ſentence of death is put upon it; <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Anſw. </seg>1</label> 
                     <hi>by the frequent viſitings of the promiſe;</hi> marke, when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends any ſpeciall Mercy to his people, he gives out a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe; then comes the ſentence of death: but if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to fulfill the promiſe; he does cauſe the promiſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to viſit the Soule, even when the ſentence of death is upon the buſineſſe; often to knock at the doore of the Soule. When there is <hi>Good-will</hi> between two Young people kept from marrying by their Parents, and the Young man often is at the houſe; ye ſay, ſurely, if the Parents were but dead, there would be a marriage quickly, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent viſitings. So now, when the promiſe does frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:170112:84"/>
                     <hi>viſit</hi> the Soule in the time when the ſentence of death is upon the buſineſſe, it argues that the Mercy is not quite dead. <hi>Moſes</hi> had a promiſe in a viſion: the Buſh burning, and not conſuming; <hi>Iſrael</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and not deſtroyed: <hi>Moſes,</hi> he carries this promiſe along with him in his boſome: indeed we do not reade of it till <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to die; and when <hi>Moſes</hi> comes to bleſſe the People:<note place="margin">Deu. 33.16.</note> 
                     <hi>The good will of him that dwelt in the Buſh, be with you.</hi> This ſame promiſe kept <hi>Moſes</hi> company all along; and though the ſentence of death was often put upon the buſineſſe, yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, in that the Mercy came and viſited him, it ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gued that this promiſe was not quite dead. So by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>iſitings</hi> of the ſame promiſe;<note place="margin">Job. 14.9.</note> 
                     <hi>Though the Tree be cutt down; yet through the ſent of thoſe waters it ſhall riſe again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But eſpecially, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> in the ſecond place: A Chriſtian may have ſome comfortable perſwaſion, that the Mercy is not dead, but ſleepeth <hi>By the Firſt-fruits of the promiſe.</hi> When the Jews kept the Feaſt of the <hi>Firſt-fruits;</hi> they knew that the Harveſt was not farre off. And ſo, when the Firſt-fruits of a Mercy comes, we may know that the Mercy, or bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is not farre off. Beloved, God does uſe to give the Firſt-fruits of a bleſſing, before the great bleſſing comes. It's a good ſpeech of one ſayes he: God does with the ſame ſeale, ſeale divers matters; one Mercy is made a ſeale to another. God does give one Mercy, as a pledge of another, and as a ſeal of another. And ſo our Saviour Chriſt does, in that 9. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> we reade of a certain Ruler, that came to him for his Daughter; and he ſaid, (at the 18. verſe) <hi>My Daughter is ever now dead, but come, and lay thine hand upon her, and ſhee ſhall live.</hi> Here was his unbeliefe, that he ſhould ſay: Come and lay thine hand upon her; Chriſt could have healed her, without coming to her: But Jeſus aroſe, and followed him. <hi>And behold a woman</hi> (at the 20. verſe) <hi>which was diſeaſed with an iſſue of blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of his garment: Jeſus turned him about, and when he ſaw her, he ſaid, Daughter, be of good comfort, thy
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:170112:84"/>Faith hath made thee whole. And the woman was made whole from that ſame houre: And when Jeſus came into the Rulers houſe, and ſaw the Minſtrels, and the People making a noiſe: He ſaid unto them, Give place, for the maid is not dead, but fleepeth: And they laught him to ſcorne.</hi> He did a miracle in the way, as a pledge unto them that he would do this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle alſo, that he would raiſe up his daughter: and by this miracle that he did in the way, he did give them a ſeale of the miracle following, of the Mercy following. Thus he does many times.</p>
                  <p>Thus he dealt by <hi>David:</hi> the Lord made <hi>David</hi> a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of the Kingdome, to give him the Kingdome, bring him to the Throne: <hi>David,</hi> he is thruſt out into the Wilderneſſe: well, when he is there, <hi>Saul</hi> he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes him, hunts him; <hi>Saul,</hi> comes ſo neare him, as that <hi>Saul</hi> is on one ſide the hill, and he on the other, nearer: But even there <hi>Saul</hi> is delivered into the hand of <hi>David.</hi> This now, this Mercy here in the Wilderneſſe, was a pledge to him of the Kingdome afterward. So now is it with you: hath the Lord given you a promiſe of ſome great bleſſing, or ſome great Mercy? and thereupon does the ſentence of death come upon it, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it? In the <hi>interim,</hi> between the promiſe, and the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling; does the Lord deliver you from ſome affliction that riſes up in your way: the Interim-mercy, the deliverance being of the ſame nature with the Mercy promiſed, is a pledge unto you, that the Mercy ſhall riſe againe; though the ſentence of death be now upon it. And thus you ſhould look upon things.</p>
                  <p>But while I am upon this, 'Tis enough for the <hi>Reliance</hi> of the Soule upon God, A <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy: I ſay, a <hi>may be</hi> of Mercy, is enough for the act of Reliance. And this Doctrine alwayes hold forth this truth unto you, that there is a <hi>may be;</hi> becauſe, when God intends to fulfill his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, by giving any ſpeciall bleſſing, or Mercy to the children of <hi>Abraham;</hi> he does firſt of all put the ſentence of death upon the bleſſing, and upon all the means that do lead unto it.
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:170112:85"/>Shall we not then waite upon him? keep ſilence in the day of trouble.</p>
                  <p>I'le give you two or three incouragements hereunto, and ſo I will winde up all.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The ſentence of death (you ſay) is upon the Mercy, or the bleſſing that you do much deſire. If ever the Mercy riſe, and the grave-cloathes be taken off; it ſhall be the choiſeſt Mercy that ever you had in all your lives. <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham</hi> had divers ſons, but the jewell was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the dead Mercy: <hi>Hannah</hi> had divers children, but who like <hi>Samuel?</hi> the <hi>found</hi> Mercy? Mercy once <hi>loſt,</hi> and then <hi>found,</hi> is a choiſe Mercy, it is the greateſt Mercy. Firſt I ſay, If ever you come to find the Mercy you have loſt; if ever that riſe which the ſentence of death is put upon, it ſhall be the greateſt Mercy. <hi>Job</hi> had a good Eſtate: but when all was plunder'd, a ſentence of death came upon all: when he came to his comforts, and his Eſtate againe, then it was done. Some have obſerved concerning <hi>Joſeph,</hi> that according to the ſeverall links of his <hi>Affliction,</hi> were the pearles in the crown of his Mercy: Ther's obſerved ſome <hi>eight</hi> or <hi>nine.</hi> I ſhallnot have time to inlarge my ſelf in them; onely thus: <hi>Joſeph</hi> he is ſold by his Brethren into <hi>Egypt;</hi> Anſwerable unto that, <hi>Joſephs</hi> Brethren come down to <hi>Egypt,</hi> and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip before him. <hi>Joſeph</hi> is accuſed for wronging his Miſtriſſe, ſad reproaches caſt upon him; Anſwerable to that, a He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rauld proclaimes before him: <hi>This is the man whom the King honours. Joſeph</hi> is thrown into priſon, the irons enter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his ſoule; Anſwerable to that, a chaine of gold is hung about his necke. <hi>Joſeph</hi> a poor ſtranger, brought as low, as ever man was; Anſwerable to that, he is made next in the Kingdome to <hi>Pharoah.</hi> Beloved, if the dead Mercy riſe: as your bodies when they riſe, they riſe in glory: So when the Mercy riſes, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> it will riſe a glorious Mercy. And as it ſhall be the greateſt Mercy that ever you had: ſo it ſhall be the <hi>ſureſt.</hi> That is moſt certain, that is certain after uncertainty. Whoſe aſſurance was like to <hi>Thomas's?</hi> Oh! ſayes <hi>Thomas,</hi> My Lord, and My God; two <hi>My's,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:170112:85"/>My Lord, and My God;</hi> it came out of doubting. A Tree that ſtands after ſhaking, ſtands the moſt firmly: Aſſurance after doubting is the ſtrongeſt Aſſurance, ſureſt Aſſurance. As 'tis the greateſt Mercy; ſo I ſay, it ſhall be the ſureſt Mercy, if ever the Mercy riſe.</p>
                  <p>And then againe, Laſtly: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As the ſureſt, ſo it ſhall be the <hi>ſweeteſt</hi> Mercy. The children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> they had whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome meat, and water, and drinke: but the ſweeteſt water was that, which they had after no water: water out of a rocke, that was like hony: And a Mercy that comes out of a rocke, that comes from out of the ſentence of death, from under death; it ſhall be the ſweeteſt Mercy. You know what the Father of the Prodigall ſayes, when his ſon was come home: he cals his friends together:<note place="margin">Lak. 15.32.</note> 
                     <hi>Come</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>and make merry with me; for this my ſon was dead, and is now alive:</hi> Cals his friends together, and ſpeaks thus unto them. So ſhall it be with the Soule, when the Mercy loſt, is found, when the Mercy dead is raiſed: then the Soule ſhall call in his friends; Come, O my friends; Come, Ile tell you what the Lord hath done for my Soule: here, here is a Mercy dead, and 'tis now alive: Come, make merry with me, O my friends; this my <hi>Aſſurance</hi> it was even dead, and 'tis now alive: Oh! this <hi>Bleſſing,</hi> this Bleſſing it was dead; but 'tis now alive: Come and make merry with me, O my friends; for this Mercy was dead, and 'tis now alive. Thus I ſay: if this Mercy riſe that hath the ſentence of death upon it; it ſhall be the <hi>greateſt</hi> Mercy; it ſhall be the <hi>ſureſt;</hi> and it ſhall be the <hi>ſweeteſt</hi> Mercy, that ever you had in all your dayes. And therefore, who would not waite upon the Lord? who would not waite upon the Lord, when the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death is put upon the Mercy, and upon all the manes that do lead unto it? Oh! my beloved in the Lord; that you would but poſſeſſe your hearts of this <hi>one Truth,</hi> this Mercy: how quiet would your Soules be under all the diſtempers, and the troubles of the time; <hi>Nationall</hi> diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, <hi>Perſonall</hi> diſtempers. When you look upon the troubles that are abroad; yet your hearts would be quiet, and you
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:170112:86"/>would ſay, well, but yet notwithſtanding, we may be in the way to the greateſt Mercy that ever <hi>England</hi> ſaw; why ſhould we be thus diſcouraged? Oh! my Soule waite upon God, this is Gods way; he never gives any great Mercy to any of his people; but firſt he does put a ſentence of death upon it, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it: And therefore, notwithſtanding all, yet we may be in Gods way: Therefore, Oh! my Soule, waite on him.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is this: <hi>That when God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to fulfill his promiſe, by giving any ſpeciall bleſſing to the children of</hi> Abraham: <hi>he does firſt put the ſentence of death upon the bleſſing, and upon all the meanes that do lead unto it: A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brahams</hi> body is dead, and <hi>Sarahs</hi> wombe is dead; when God had promiſed him a great ſeed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Second</hi> is this: <hi>When God is thus pleaſed to put the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death upon a bleſſing, or the meanes that do lead there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: Then, and then eſpecially, 'tis the duty and commendation of all the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>to beleeve in God, and not to ſtand poring upon the meanes, and the deadneſſe thereof. He conſidered not his own body being dead, nor the deadneſſe of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rahs <hi>wombe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Third</hi> is this: <hi>That no difficulty can ſtand before Faith: true ſaving, juſtifying Faith, carries the Soule through all difficulties, diſcouragements, and naturall impoſſibilities to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Thus it was here with <hi>Abraham:</hi> he being not weak in Faith, he had an eye unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <pb n="174" facs="tcp:170112:87"/>
                  <p>I have done with the Firſt; and my deſire is now at this time, to diſpatch the Second.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>When God is pleaſed thus to put the ſentence of death upon a bleſſing;</hi>

                     <hi>or the meanes that do lead unto it: it is the duty of the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>then to truſt in God; not to ſtand poring upon, or conſidering of the meanes, and the deadneſſe thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it was here with <hi>Abraham:</hi> God made <hi>Abraham</hi> a promiſe that his ſeed ſhould be like the ſand, and like the ſtarres for multitude: But <hi>Abrahams</hi> body is dead, and his wives body is dead: Notwithſtanding, <hi>Abraham</hi> conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered not the deadneſſe of the meanes. And in all this he is held forth for our <hi>Example,</hi> as you heard the laſt day. As he did therefore ſo muſt we do.</p>
                  <p>The Doctrine is ſomewhat large. I ſhall break it aſunder into three parts, and endeavour to cleare up theſe three <hi>Propoſitions</hi> unto you, for the proof of the whole.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> That a meere rationall conſidering of the meanes, and the deadneſſe thereof: is a great, and a ſpeciall enemy to the work of beleeving.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> That when all means faile, 'tis the duty, and commendation of the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi> then to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> That ſo to do, is exceeding pleaſing to God, and moſt acceptable.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>That a meere rationall conſidering of the meanes: the ſtraitneſſe, or ſcantineſſe; narrowneſſe, or deadneſſe of the meanes, is a great, and a ſpeciall enemy to the work of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> being not weak in Faith, conſidered not his own body being dead. If he had conſidered, he might have been hindered in his Faith.</p>
                  <p>Ye reade of <hi>Zacharias</hi> (that good man, Father of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi>) that when the Angell brought him tidings of a child, in way of his ſpeciall Mercy; he would not beleeve it. And in the 1. of <hi>Luke,</hi> and the 20. verſe: ye reade how he was puniſhed for it: <hi>Behold, thou ſhalt be dumbe, and not
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:170112:87"/>able to ſpeak, untill the day that theſe things ſhall be performed, becauſe thou beleeveſt not my words.</hi> But what hindred him? what kept him off from this work of beleeving? you ſhall find at the 18. verſe; too much attendance unto, and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering of the meanes, and the deadneſſe thereof. <hi>Zachary ſaid unto the Angell, Whereby ſhall I know this? for I am an old man, and my wife well ſtricken in years.</hi> He look't too much upon, and conſidered, he ſtood poring too much upon the meanes; and this was the enemy unto his Faith. You know Beloved, that the Scripture hath laid a flat oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion between Faith, and ſence. We live by Faith, ſayes the Apoſtle, <hi>and not by ſight,</hi> or by ſence. The reaſons drawn from <hi>ſence,</hi> are <hi>ſence:</hi> and when a man does live by reaſon drawn from <hi>ſence,</hi> and beares up his heart therewithall, he does live by <hi>ſence.</hi> If you live by <hi>Faith,</hi> you don't live by <hi>ſence:</hi> if you do live by <hi>ſence,</hi> you don't live by <hi>Faith.</hi> They are as two buckets, the life of Faith, and the life of ſence; when one goes up, the other goes down: the higher Faith riſeth, the lower ſence and reaſon: and the higher ſence and reaſon, the lower Faith. That is true of the ſchooles, Reaſon going before Faith, weakens, and diminiſheth it: But Reaſon following upon Faith, increaſes and ſtrengthens it. Beſides, you know <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes; <hi>Not many wiſe &amp;c.</hi> Why not many wiſe called? Thoſe that are wiſe, they conſider the things of God, and of the Goſpel in a <hi>meere rationall way,</hi> and therefore not many wiſe are called: it hinders them from the worke of beleeving: <hi>Luther</hi> ſayes well: <hi>If you would beleeve</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>you muſt crucify that Queſtion, why? God would not have us ſo full of wherefores.</hi> And if you would beleeve, you muſt go blindfold into Gods command: <hi>Abraham</hi> ſubſcribes to a blank, when the Lord called him out of his own Countrey.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Beſides,</hi> You know the great field that <hi>Faith</hi> hath to work in; the large and vaſt <hi>Orbe,</hi> and <hi>Sphear</hi> that it hath to move in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Faith</hi> can go into the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> and run up as high as <hi>Adam,</hi> and come back again to the Soul, and tel the Soul: I have ſeene a man whom God hath pardoned that <hi>damn'd</hi> all the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170112:88"/>World; and why may he not pardon thee? Faith can runne up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and come home againe to the Soule; and ſay, I have ſeene the <hi>Glory</hi> there: be of good comfort, ther's enough in Heaven to pay for all. Faith can runne unto <hi>Gods All-ſufficiency,</hi> to <hi>Gods Omnipotency;</hi> and having viewed that well, it returnes to the Soule home againe; and ſayes, be quiet, ther's enough in God alone: and Faith having placed, and ſeated it ſelfe upon this high Tower and Mountaine; Gods <hi>Omnipotency</hi> and <hi>All-ſufficiency;</hi> it hath a great proſpect, it can look over all the World, and look into another World too: but now <hi>Reaſon,</hi> it gets upon ſome little <hi>Mole-hill</hi> of <hi>Creature-ability;</hi> and if it can ſee over two or three hedges, 'tis well And therefore; Oh! what a paine is it to <hi>Faith,</hi> to be tied to <hi>Reaſon.</hi> I ſuppoſe you will all ſay, that if a man were able to go a journey of two or three hundred miles a foote, he were a very good footman: yet if you will tie him to carry a child of foure or five years old with him; you will ſay, it would be a great <hi>luggage</hi> to him; and the man would ſay, pray let this child be left at home: for though he may runne along in my hand half a mile, or go a mile with me; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding I muſt carry him the reſt of the way: and when I come at any great water, or to go over any hill, I muſt take him upon my backe; and that will be a great burden to me. And thus 'tis betweene <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Reaſon: Reaſon</hi> (at the beſt) is but a child to <hi>Faith: Faith</hi> can foot it over <hi>Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines</hi> and <hi>Difficulties,</hi> and wade through <hi>Afflictions,</hi> though they be very wide: but when Reaſon comes to any <hi>Affliction,</hi> to wade through that, and to go over ſome great <hi>Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> then it cries out and ſayes, Oh! <hi>Faith,</hi> good <hi>Faith</hi> go backe againe, good <hi>Faith</hi> go backe againe: No (ſayes <hi>Faith</hi>) but i'le take thee upon my backe <hi>Reaſon:</hi> and ſo Faith is fain to do indeed; take <hi>Reaſon</hi> upon its backe: but, Oh! what a <hi>luggage</hi> is <hi>Reaſon</hi> to <hi>Faith?</hi> Oh! what a burden is Reaſon to <hi>Faith? Faith</hi> never works better, then when it works moſt alone. The meere rationall conſidering of the means, and the deadneſſe thereof, is a great and ſpeciall ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:170112:88"/>to the worke of beleeving. That is the Firſt.</p>
                  <p>The Second Propoſition is this; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>That when all meanes faile, and ſeem to lye dead before us; then it is the duty, and commendation of all the children of</hi> Abraham, <hi>to beleeve:</hi> That is, to beleeve the thing may be, and ſo to reſt, and relye on God in Chriſt. Thus it was here with <hi>Abraham.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And hath not the Lord commanded by the Apoſtle, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; <hi>Let them that ſuffer according to the will of God, commit the keeping of their Soules to the hand of God, as into the hand of a Faithfull Creator?</hi> the 1 of <hi>Peter</hi> 4.19. When ye are ſcrupled about your <hi>Election</hi> or <hi>Reprobation,</hi> you look upon God, as a Potter, that hath power over the clay, to make it either a Veſſel of honour or diſhonour: But when you are to beleeve, then you are not to look upon God as a <hi>Potter,</hi> that workes out of <hi>clay,</hi> or out of <hi>materials;</hi> but as a <hi>Creator,</hi> that workes out of <hi>nothing;</hi> yea as a <hi>faithfull</hi> Creator, that will be ſure to worke out of nothing, whom you ſhall be ſure of. Thus then you are to look upon him. You know the place in the third of <hi>Habakuk,</hi> and the 17. verſe: <hi>Although the Fig-tree ſhall not bloſſome, neither ſhall fruit be in the Vines, the labour of the Olive ſhall faile, and the Fields ſhall yeeld no meate, the flocke ſhall be cutt off from the fold, and there ſhall be no herd in the ſtals; yet I will rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation; the Lord God is my ſtrength &amp;c.</hi> Thus <hi>Habakuk</hi> beleeved. Beloved, we are ſo to beleeve as the promiſe runnes; Gods promiſe is the rule of our Faith: look how that ſpeakes, ſo may we beleeve. The promiſe and Faith is the buckle and claſpe fit for one another. Now the Lord does not onely promiſe to helpe the children of <hi>Abraham,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 41 17.</note> but he promiſes to helpe when all meanes faile: <hi>When the poor and needy ſeeke for water, and there's none.</hi> I pray look into that third of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and the 8. verſe: <hi>Behold,</hi> (ſayes the Lord) <hi>I will bring them from the north Country:</hi> his people ſcattered here into the Land of the North. <hi>And gather them from the coaſts of the Earth, and with them the blinde and the lame, the woman with childe, and her that travaileth with child together, a great company
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170112:89"/>ſhall returne hither.</hi> The Lord promiſes to bring them backe to their owne Country from the Land of the North.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Math. 4.4</note> Now if you look into the eighth of <hi>Deutero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy,</hi> and the third verſe, you will find, that thoſe words were ſpoken upon an extraordinary occaſion, help beyond meanes: <hi>He humbled thee, and ſuffered thee to hunger, and fed thee with</hi> Manna, <hi>which thou kneweſt not, neither did thy fathers know: that hee might make thee know that man doth not live by bread onely, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo here in this fourth of the <hi>Romans, Abraham</hi> belee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when all meanes failed, he beleeved the promiſe, and he
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170112:89"/>is brought down for our example, that we ſhould beleeve the promiſe alſo when meanes faile. And if you look into, and conſider the eleventh of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> where you have a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talogue of many beleevers, ye ſhall find, that many of them, beleeved when the means failed, beyond meanes, and yet they are all brought downe, and made mention of for our example.</p>
                  <p>Surely, therefore tis the duty of the children of <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> to beleeve when all meanes faile, and ſeeme to be dead before us: Meanes for the <hi>Soule,</hi> Meanes for the <hi>Body,</hi> Means for the <hi>Family:</hi> Meanes for the <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Take this for the reaſon: <label type="milestone">

                     <hi>Such a Faith is to be exerciſed unto God, as is ſutable unto that God in whom we do beleeve.</hi> If the God in whom we do beleeve were a God that did helpe onely by meanes, then we were to truſt ſo unto him: but being he is ſuch a God as workes beyond meanes, we are to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe a faith towards him, ſutable to this God in whom we do beleeve. So in regard of our <hi>Love;</hi> We muſt <hi>love</hi> God with a <hi>love</hi> worthy of God. Now if a man ſhould onely love God, for benefits and bleſſings that he receives from him: and not for the holineſſe, and excellency that is in God himſelfe; this love were not worthy of God. So in regard of our <hi>faith:</hi> if we ſhould onely <hi>beleeve</hi> God in regard of the reaſon, and experiences, and means; this faith were no way worthy of God. I will beleeve a man, I will beleeve the worſt of men, the vileſt man, ſo farre as I can ſee him, and ſhall I beleeve God no further? We muſt beleeve with a faith worthy of God; faith is not worthy of God, unleſſe we beleeve beyond meanes; this is the faith that is worthy of God; this is the faith required, and commended. Take but one Scripture for it more. In the ſeventeenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> there were ten Lepers came unto Chriſt, deſiring cure, ſaying, <hi>Jeſus, Maſter have mercy on us</hi> (at the thirteenth verſe) <hi>When he ſaw them, he ſaid to them go ſhew your ſelves unto the Prieſts. And it came to paſſe as they went they were cleanſed.</hi> It ſeems they were not cleanſed then as he ſpake, they were not clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed when Chriſt ſayes, <hi>Go and ſhew your ſelves to the Prieſts:</hi>
                     <pb n="180" facs="tcp:170112:90"/>for it is ſaid, <hi>as they went they were cleanſed.</hi> Why then ſhould they ſhew themſelves to the Prieſts? They were to ſhew themſelves to the Prieſts, to bring an offering for their clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing: yet, ſayes our Saviour, <hi>go ſhew your ſelves to the Prieſts:</hi> They were to beleeve that they ſhould be cleanſed, although they ſaw themſelves full of Leproſie.</p>
                  <p>So, although a ſoule ſees himſelfe to be full of Leproſy, yet notwithſtanding it is to rely upon Jeſus Chriſt, and to beleeve as if he were fully cleanſed: This is the ſecond Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition.</p>
                  <p>The third will make out this the more full: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>Thus to beleeve when all meanes faile, is exceeding pleaſing to God, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This kind of faith Chriſt commends in <hi>Thomas:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Joh. 20.29</note> Thomas (ſayes Chriſt) <hi>thou haſt beleeved becauſe thou haſt ſeene; but bleſſed are thoſe that do beleeve and have not ſeen.</hi> Bleſſed is any man that does beleeve, though his hands may be full of ſence: but of all beleevers, bleſſed is that beleever, that beleeves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond ſence, that beleeves and hath not ſeene.</p>
                  <p>There are two eſpecially that Jeſus Chriſt does commend for beleeving:<note place="margin">Mat 15.28 Mat. 8 10</note> the <hi>Canaanitiſh woman;</hi> and the <hi>Centurion.</hi> To the one, ſayes he, <hi>O woman great is thy faith.</hi> Concern<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing the other: <hi>I have not ſeene ſuch faith, no not in Jſrael.</hi> And both of theſe beleeved above hope, and under hope, when the meanes in view, ſeemed to chide them off from beleeving. In that eleventh of the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> many of the Saints are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for their Faith: They had other graces, wherein they did excell: <hi>Moſes</hi> was a <hi>Meeke</hi> man, he is not recorded there, and commended for his meekneſſe, but for his <hi>Faith. Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> was a <hi>ſtout,</hi> and a <hi>reſolute</hi> man: he is not commended there for that, but for his <hi>Faith.</hi> They had other excellent graces, but this grace of Faith is ſingled out to weare the Crown:<note place="margin">Heb. 11.39</note> 
                     <hi>They all obtain'd a good report through Faith.</hi> That weares the Crowne of all other graces. And you ſhall find that that Faith was mingled with many <hi>weakneſſes: Rahab,</hi> one of thoſe beleevers, what a deale of weakneſſe paſſed from her, in her beleeving. Yet notwithſtanding, though their
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:170112:90"/>Faith was clogged with many <hi>weakneſſes,</hi> yet their Faith is commended, and moſt of them beleeving beyond means, and when all meanes failed: plainly ſpeaking out this truth to us: The great acceptation that ſuch a Faith hath with God. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved! this faith, beleeving when all meanes faile, and lye dead before us, turnes God about; (as we may ſpeak with reverence) and make God, of an enemy, a ſeeming enemy; to become our friend. If you truſt unto your <hi>friend,</hi> for a kindneſſe; he will do it becauſe you reſt on him: if you reſt upon an <hi>enemy,</hi> he failes you: but if you reſt on God, he will therefore do it becauſe you reſt on him, and he will become your friend by your reſting on him. Oh! I have been a great and a wretched ſinner: Yet notwithſtanding, I know there is infinite riches of grace in Chriſt, and therefore ſayes the ſoule, I will reſt on him: <hi>yea Lord, though thou kill me, yet will I reſt upon thee.</hi> I, (ſaies the Lord) wilt thou now reſt upon mee, now I frown, now I chide, now I have a rod in my hand, now I have a ſword in my hand to kill thee (as it were) wilt thou now reſt upon mee? Well, be of good comfort, thou art mine for ever: Man, or woman, go in peace, good is thy faith. This reſting thus upon God, when all meanes faile, it melts Gods anger into love.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>beſides,</hi> it is that faith that is moſt <hi>ſucceſſefull,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the moſt ſpeeding in prayer. You may look into the ſecond of <hi>Chronicles</hi> the thirteenth Chapter, and you ſhall find there, that <hi>Abijah</hi> going to warre with <hi>Jeroboam,</hi> had not more then halfe ſo many as <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had. Abijah <hi>ſet the battaile in array with an Army of valiant men of warre, even foure hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand choſen men:</hi> A great Army. But <hi>Jeroboam</hi> had as many againe. <hi>And</hi> Jeroboam <hi>alſo ſet the battale in array againſt him with eight hundred thouſand choſen men, being migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty men of valour.</hi> I pray now let us conſider, how went the day? Reade the ſeventeenth verſe. Abijah <hi>and his people ſlew them with a great ſlaughter: ſo there fell down of Iſrael five hundred thouſand choſen men:</hi> Five hundred thouſand choſen men ſlaine. How came this about? Reade the eighteenth verſe. <hi>Thus the children of Iſrael were brought under at that
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170112:91"/>time, and the children of Judah prevailed, becauſe they relyed upon the Lord God of their Fathers.</hi> Or as ſome books have it, <hi>becauſe they ſtayed upon the Lord God of their father.</hi> The meanes was too ſcanty, it was ſhort; they reſted upon God beyond the meanes, and ſee what great ſucceſſe they had upon this: they were but foure hundred thouſand, againſt either hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand; and they ſlew five hundred thouſand men. So ſucceſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full is this worke, and this way of beleeving.</p>
                  <p>It is this faith that now I am ſpeaking of; beleeving when all means faile, and lye dead before us: that does honour God eſpecially; which doth juſtify the ſoule: <hi>It is the ſoule-ſaving faith of all.</hi> Pray looke into the ſeventh of <hi>Luke,</hi> and conſider it well. It is ſaid at the laſt verſe. <hi>Jeſus ſaid to the woman, they Faith hath ſaved thee, go in peace:</hi> but here's no mention at all before of her <hi>Faith:</hi> There's mention of her <hi>love,</hi> in the fourty ſeventh verſe, <hi>I ſay unto thee, her ſins, which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> There's mention be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of her <hi>teares,</hi> at the eight and thirty verſe. <hi>A woman in the City; which was a ſinner, brought an Alabaſter box of oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ſtood at his feete behind him weeping, and began to waſh his feete with teares, and did wipe them with the haires of her head, and kiſſed his feete, and annointed them with the oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Here's mention of her <hi>teares,</hi> here's mention of her <hi>Liberality,</hi> and <hi>Bounty,</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> to Jeſus Chriſt: and yet our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, does not ſay thus: woman, thy teares hath ſaved thee, go in peace: Woman thy <hi>Repentance,</hi> and thy <hi>Humiliation</hi> hath ſaved thee, go in peace, he doth not ſay, thy <hi>Love</hi> to me, and thy <hi>Bounty</hi> to me hath ſaved thee, go in peace, woman: No, but our Lord and Saviour, he ſaw a ſecret worke of reliance upon himſelfe in this woman, for ſhe was a great ſinner, and he ſayes unto her, woman, Thy <hi>Faith</hi> hath ſaved thee, goe in Peace. This is the <hi>ſoule-ſaving faith,</hi> thus to beleeve when all meanes faile, and ſeeme to lye dead before you. Surely therefore, to do thus, muſt needs be exceeding pleaſing to God, and moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
                  <p>And ſo I have done with thoſe three Propoſitions:<note place="margin">Applic.</note> and now come to the Application.</p>
                  <pb n="183" facs="tcp:170112:91"/>
                  <p>If theſe things be ſo: Oh! what manner of Faith ſhould we have? Will ye only beleeve when meanes are ſtrong, and have life in them? Ye have read of the unbeliefe of the people of Iſrael when they were in the wilderneſſe: being in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, they wanted much outward proviſion, ordinary proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and by occaſion thereof they murmured, full of unbelief, in ſo much as the Lord was angry with them, and ſlew them, ſo that they never came into the Land of promiſe. But I pray, what was their unbelief, for which God did ſlay them? Was it this that they did not beleeve when they had meanes? No, but that they did not beleeve when all means failed, when all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward meanes failed; that is their unbeliefe.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, we have their <hi>promiſes,</hi> we have their <hi>Example,</hi> we have more meanes of faith then they; and ſhall not our Faith riſe higher then theirs? Shall not we beleeve an inch be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the meanes? You have heard the Doctrine: <hi>Tis the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of all the children of</hi> Abraham <hi>to beleeve when meanes faile, 'tis exceeding pleaſing to God, and 'tis moſt acceptable.</hi> Oh! What an incouragement is here, to beleeve above hope, and under hope, and when death ſits upon the lips of the ſecond cauſe, and ſpeakes nothing but terror! Some there are, that ſay, they can beleeve for their <hi>bodies,</hi> but they cannot truſt God for their <hi>Soules</hi> when meanes faile: Some ſay, they can truſt God for their <hi>Soules</hi> when meanes faile, but they cannot truſt God for their <hi>Bodies:</hi> ſome ſay, they can truſt God for <hi>Them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves</hi> but they cannot truſt God for their <hi>Families;</hi> what ſhall become of my wife and children? Some ſay, they can truſt God for their <hi>Families;</hi> but they cannot truſt God for the <hi>Church;</hi> when a ſtrome riſes, they cry out and ſay, Lord, careſt thou not that we periſh? though Jeſus Chriſt be in the ſhip with them.</p>
                  <p>We are very ready, and apt to hunt after the meanes when we want them: and to reſt upon them when we have them. And there is a great propenſneſſe in us to <hi>doing,</hi> rather then unto <hi>beleeving;</hi> before <hi>converſion:</hi> and in the point of <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion.</hi>

                  <p>Beloved, there is a time when God does purpoſely take away the meanes to try a mans Faith. God does firſt try our Faith, before he does feed our ſence. When our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, was to worke that great miracle, feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many thouſand with five barley loaves, and two ſmall fiſhes, we reade in the ſixth Chapter of <hi>John,</hi> and the 5. verſe thus, <hi>Jeſus lift up his eyes, and ſaw a great company, and ſaid to</hi> Philip, <hi>whence ſhall we buy bread, that theſe may eate?</hi> Why did our Saviour Chriſt thus put <hi>Philip</hi> upon it? reade what followes. <hi>And this he ſaid to prove him:</hi> He took away the meanes; <hi>and this he ſaid to prove him.</hi> There is a time when the Lord does ſometimes take away the meanes on purpoſe to prove thy Faith; how doeſt thou know, (man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) whether this be not the day and the time? Thou ſayeſt, thou canſt not beleeve, becauſe meanes faile; it may be 'tis the time of thy triall, God ſending this time of purpoſe to try thee.</p>
                  <p>Again ſecondly, Conſider this; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> God does never give to ſupply our <hi>luſts,</hi> but to ſupply our <hi>wants.</hi> Poſſibly there may be meanes to ſupply thy want, though not meanes to ſupply thy luſt. When our Lord and Saviour Chriſt fed ſo many thouſand, what did he feed them with? <hi>Five barley loaves and two fiſhes;</hi> not with <hi>Turkey,</hi> not with <hi>Partridges,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iohn 6.9.</note> not with <hi>Quailes,</hi> not with <hi>Chickens;</hi> but with barley loaves.</p>
                  <p>It may be thou haſt a <hi>barley loafe-meanes,</hi> but thou haſt not <hi>Chicken-meanes;</hi> and becauſe thou haſt not meanes to ſupply thine <hi>appetite,</hi> and to ſupply thy <hi>luſt,</hi> thou ſayeſt thou haſt no meanes, and all meanes faile: Oh! this is very ordinary among ſome people; becauſe they have not meanes to ſatisfy their mind and their luſt, therefore they ſay, that all meanes faile. I beſeech you <hi>Beloved,</hi> conſider whether there be not this great miſtake, when you ſay, that all meanes
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:170112:93"/>faile; onely a failing of meanes to ſupply your appetite and your luſt, but not a failing of <hi>barley loave-meanes;</hi> whether there be not alwayes that meanes left by God.</p>
                  <p>In the third place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> But ſuppoſe that all meanes faile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, and lie dead before you; now Faith is a meanes to a meanes: (marke) now Faith is a meanes to Faith, Faith hath a commiſſion from God to put life into that meanes that lies dead before you; Faith hath a power from God to make that a <hi>meanes</hi> which was none before. <hi>Poor Soule,</hi> thou ſtand'ſt quaking and ſhaking at a diſtance &amp; ſayeſt, Oh! there's no meanes but contrary meanes: Come up to that contrary meanes, come up to it in a way of beleeving, and thy very coming up to that which thou look'ſt upon as contrary, through thy faith will be made a meanes to thee. When the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> was in priſon, the Angel comes to him, ſtrikes off his chaines, and bids him go out preſently; <hi>Peter</hi> does not ſay thus, what ſhould I ſtirre for? Lord, Sir, there is an iron gate to go through, there are ſo many guardes of Souldiers to paſſe through; <hi>Peter</hi> does not ſay ſo, but riſes in a way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeving, comes to the iron gate in Faith, and when he comes at it, the iron gate doth open: And ſo it will be with you; indeed if you come unto that which ſeemes a contrary means, in a naturall way, the iron gate ſtill continues ſhut; but Oh! if you would uſe your Faith, come up unto that which you look upon as the moſt contrary, in the way of beleeving, faith hath ſuch a power from God, to put life into that meanes that lies dead before you.</p>

For a man to thinke that he ſhall fly in the ayre with wings like a bird, this is to preſume for a man to put God upon proviſion for his luſt, this is to preſume: for a man to put God upon extraordinary, where ordinary may be had, this is to preſume.</p>
                  <p>But for a man to relie upon God for neceſſities in extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary caſes, when ordinary cannot be had; this is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, but Faith.

                  <p>As for example: one poore Subject to go to his Prince, and tye up his hands and feet, or to go to his Pallace, and nayle up all his doores, and leave him but one little wicket to come out at; this is preſumption. And ſo, for a man to tye God to meanes, to tye God to a time, to tye God to this or that meanes, to tye God to meanes in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall: this is preſumption.

As a diſhonour to God; ſo a great hinderance to your ſelves to doe thus: it turnes God out of the way of his mercy; Nay, (ſayes God) ſeeing you will have no mercy but in a roade of meanes, you ſhall have none but in a roade of meanes; ſo mercy comes thinne, and ſcant, and by little drops; whereas otherwiſe mercy would come thick, and full, and large.</p>
                  <p>Hereby you are put upon indirect meanes to get out of trouble: pray, what is the ground that cauſes men to uſe indirect meanes to get out of trouble? is not this at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome? you thinke meanes muſt be uſed; this is at the bottome.</p>

                     <hi>Beloved in the Lord,</hi> as you do deſire God may not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honoured, that Mercy may come full and not ſcant unto you, learne to beleeve at another rate then ever you have done; when all meanes faile and ſeeme to lie dead before you, then beleeve: ſo for thy <hi>Soule,</hi> ſo for thy <hi>Body,</hi> ſo for thy <hi>Eſtate.</hi>

<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170112:95"/>compariſons between one duty and another; but if there be any compares, this act of beleeving when all meanes ſeeme to lie dead before us, is more then all thy prayers and teares: Thou crieſt out and ſayeſt, Oh! that I had <hi>teares</hi> in prayer, Oh! that God would <hi>inlarge</hi> my heart in prayer, Oh! that God would <hi>breake</hi> this hard heart; and bleſſed be the Lord indeed when ſo it is.</p>
                  <p>But now, art thou in ſuch a caſe? haſt thou a proſpect of all thy ſins, and all means ſeem to lie dead before thee? and doeſt thou now go unto Jeſus Chriſt, ſaying to him, Ah, Lord, I have been a great and a wretched ſinner; yet now, hearing of thy free and rich grace, I do throw my ſelfe upon thee; Lord, if thou killeſt mee, yet I will truſt in thee; through thy grace, I will never returne againe unto folly; onely Lord, I do leane my Soule upon thee; as for comfort, Lord give me comfort when thou wilt; onely, I leane my Soule upon thee? I tell thee, this act of thy Faith is more pleaſing to God, then thy twenty years teares, then thy twenty years prayers, if there be any compare.</p>
                  <p>But why then <hi>(my Beloved)</hi> ſhould you look at this as a matter of preſumption, to truſt upon God and upon Chriſt in this condition? know 'tis your way unto Jeſus Chriſt when all meanes faile; Oh! 'tis the only way for your deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance, deliverance from your ſinnes, and the feare of your ſinnes; carry this rule home along with you; delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is then neareſt when Faith workes higheſt, and Faith then workes higheſt when all means are loweſt. Do not ſtand poring then, (Chriſtian) don't ſtand poring upon the deadneſſe of the meanes, or the deadneſſe of thine owne heart. As the ſight, beholding, and gazing upon beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, is a ſnare, and a temptation to thoſe that are given to wantonneſſe: and the ſight of much gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and fine houſes, a temptation to thoſe that are given to worldlineſſe: So, the ſight, and behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the deadneſſe of the meanes, is a great ſnare and temptation to thoſe that are given to doubting and thoſe that are given to unbeliefe. Does the meanes therefore lie dead

                  <p>
                     <hi>Abraham</hi> had a promiſe given him, that his ſeed ſhould be as the ſtarres of Heaven: and that in his ſeed all the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the world ſhould be bleſt. Upon this promiſe, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams</hi> body is dead, and <hi>Sarahs</hi> body is dead: Now <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> beleeves. Being not weake in Faith, he conſidered not

And in this he had an eye unto Jeſus Chriſt: for this was imputed to him for righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe; and herein he is held forth as an example to us that beleeve with a juſtifying faith, in this chapter. So that where ever there is true, ſaving, juſtifying faith, it carries a man through all difficulties, through all naturall diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>For the clearing whereof, I ſhall deliver my ſelfe in theſe foure things.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt,</hi> I will ſhew you, <hi>That the way to Jeſus Chriſt is clog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged with many difficulties, and naturall diſcouragements:</hi> this as a rice unto all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, That true, ſaving faith, will carry one through all theſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, That nothing elſe can do it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> What <hi>it is in true, ſaving, juſtifying Faith, that does is? How this Faith comes to do it?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The way to Jeſus Chriſt is clogged with many difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, or naturall diſcouragements.</hi> No ſooner does a man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to looke after Chriſt, but difficulties, and naturall diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements do ariſe; and they are preſt by Satan with much violence. When the <hi>children of Iſrael</hi> began to make out of <hi>Egypt, Pharoah</hi> doubles their taske, and labours to make their way grievous, and troublous. And ſo ſoone as a ſoule begins to look after Chriſt; <hi>Satan,</hi> and the world labours to make his way troublous. The <hi>Devill</hi> is the great hunter of Soules: So long as the <hi>Game</hi> goes well with the hunter, and he is going into his ſnare, he makes no noiſe; but if once the <hi>Hare,</hi> or the <hi>Game</hi> begin to decline the ſnare, and go another way, then he hoopes, and he hollowes, and he makes a noiſe, that he may ſcare it into the ſnare againe. And ſo, as long as men are going into the Devils ſnare, he makes no noiſe; but if once they begin to turne aſide from his ſnare, then he raiſes Town &amp; Country, and a great noiſe is made to ſcare the ſoule in againe He knowes that a candle may be eaſily blown into light, when 'tis new put out. <hi>Paul</hi> met with no buffet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Satan, till he had been taken up into the third heavens
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170112:97"/>and ſeene the glory there. So long as <hi>Paul</hi> went on in his <hi>Pharaſaicall way,</hi> he met with no oppoſition: and ſo long as a man goes on in the way of the world, or in ſome <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſaicall Devotionall-way,</hi> that is not the way of the Goſpell, he meetes with no oppoſition: but when once the Lord takes him (as it were) into the third heavens, and ſhews him the glory of Chriſt, then Satan begins to buffer him. Nature within us, that ſtands and ſaies, Will you go to Chriſt? 'tis impoſſible that ever you ſhould get him. And the world without: Will you go to Chriſt? you will loſe all your friends: Will you become a foole too? What with the <hi>world,</hi> and what with the <hi>fleſh,</hi> and what with the <hi>Devill,</hi> the way to Jeſus Chriſt is clogged with many difficulties.</p>
                  <p>And this will appeare yet further, if you conſider the <hi>Nature</hi> of Faith and the worth of it. 'Tis a grace, a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel grace, a precious grace, whereby we do come to Chriſt. I ſay, <hi>'Tis a grace; Nulla Virtus ſine lapide.</hi> When our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was crucified, they rould a ſtone over his ſepulcher, and when the Diſciples came, they ſaid, <hi>Who ſhall roule away the ſtone?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mark 16 3</note> And as our Lord himſelfe had a ſtone roul'd upon him, ſo the more of Chriſt is in any vertue, the greater ſtone, and the greater difficulty is rould upon it; every vertue, and every grace, hath one ſtone or other that is roul'd upon it: but the more of Chriſt in any thing, the more, the greater is the ſtone that is roul'd upon it. Faith is an <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent</hi> grace.<note place="margin">1 Pet. 1.7.</note> 
                     <hi>The triall of your Faith is more precious then gold,</hi> ſayes the Apoſtle; what is Faith it ſelfe then? It is the <hi>Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencer</hi> of the Soule, the <hi>directrix</hi> or <hi>Queene-regent</hi> of all the graces, it ſits at the ſterne, and guides the whole Veſſel. 'Tis that grace that gives a <hi>Being</hi> unto a Chriſtian, other graces the <hi>Well-being.</hi> It is that grace that brings Chriſt and the Soule together: It is that grace, that covers the defects of all other graces;<note place="margin">Epheſ 6.16.</note> 'Tis called <hi>the ſhield;</hi> a ſhield does not only cover the body, but the reſt of the armour; Faith does not onely cover the Soule, but the defects of all other graces. There is an <hi>excellency</hi> in grace: excellent things and jewels they are hard to come by. Therefore by it we come unto
<pb n="195" facs="tcp:170112:97"/>Chriſt. He that comes over the River, muſt come from that ſide of the water, if he will come to this: And he that comes to Chriſt, he muſt come from his <hi>old Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtomes,</hi> and his <hi>own Engagements,</hi> and his <hi>own Righteouſneſſe:</hi> this is a hard thing. I may ſay in ſome reſpects, 'tis <hi>harder to beleeve, then to keepe the ten Commandements, becauſe there is ſomething in nature towards them.</hi> Chriſt is the way to Heaven, and Faith is the way to Chriſt (underſtand it right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) Faith is the way to Chriſt; now therefore it being ſo hard a worke to beleeve, ſurely, the way to Jeſus Chriſt muſt needs be laid with many difficulties, and naturall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements. But that is but the rice.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Though the way to Jeſus Chriſt be clogged with many difficulties, <hi>True, ſaving, juſtifying Faith, will carry us through all difficulties, diſcouragements, and naturall Impoſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 'Tis that grace that is oppoſed to the ſinful <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap> that the Apoſtle ſpeaks of; He being not weak in Faith, he conſidered not his owne body <gap reason="foreign">

And, ſo the word will fully bear that ſignification. When a man lookes upon things with an eye of reaſon, he makes a diſcretion of Dijudication of things: ſome things are <hi>facile</hi> eaſy; ſome things are hard. But when a man lookes by faith, upon the power of God, there is not that diſcretion there. All things are eaſy to the eye of faith, that lookes at the power of God. You ſhall obſerve therefore, that when our Lord and Saviour himſelfe, would beare up the hearts of his diſciples over all diſcouragements, he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects them to this worke of beleeving with a ſaving, inſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faith; you know the place, <hi>Let not your hearts be troubled,</hi>

                  <p>Firſt, our Saviour uſes this and the like expreſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving a Sycamine tree, and the mountaines; upon occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that the Diſciples could not caſt out the Divell. And of that you reade in <hi>Matth.</hi> 17.20. and there (indeed) he ſpeakes of the faith of <hi>miracles. Why could not we caſt him out?</hi> (verſe 19.) <hi>Ieſus ſaid unto them, becauſe of your unbeliefe: for verily I ſay unto you, if ye have faith as a graine of muſtard-ſeed, ye ſhall ſay unto this mountain, remove hence to yonder place, and it ſhall remove, and nothing ſhall be unpoſſible unto you.</hi> Here he ſpeakes of the faith of <hi>miracles,</hi> becauſe thereby we ſhould be able to caſt out the divell; which plainly ſpeaks a miracle.</p>
                  <p>He uſes againe this like expreſſion, upon an occaſion of the drying up of the fig-tree. And concerning that you reade in <hi>Mark</hi> 11.20. <hi>As they paſſed by, they ſaw the fig-tree dried up from the roots.</hi> Peter <hi>calling to remembrance, ſaith unto
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:170112:98"/>him, Behold, the fig-tree which thou curſedſt is withered away. Jeſus anſwering, ſaid unto them, have faith in God. And verily I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall ſay to this mountaine, be thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and be thou caſt into the ſea, and ſhall not doubt in his heart, &amp;c.</hi> Here the faith called for, is both faith of <hi>Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles,</hi> and a <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith too: a faith of <hi>miracles,</hi> it is brought in upon occaſion of this miracle, Chriſt ſayes if he hath faith, he ſhall not only do this, but he ſhall remove mountains, But here is a <hi>juſtifying</hi> faith alſo intended, for he ſayes, <hi>Have faith in God,</hi> (at the 22 verſe) ſo you reade it. But in the margent of your Bible, it is, have faith <hi>of</hi> God; when as the Scripture ſpeakes of a juſtifying faith, it uſes to ſpeak in ſuch an expreſſion as this. So <hi>Paul</hi> ſayes,<note place="margin">Gal 2.19.</note> 
                     <hi>I live by the faith of the ſon of God,</hi> ſpeaking of juſtifying faith, not by faith <hi>in</hi> the Son of God. So in <hi>Rev.</hi> 14. 'tis called <hi>the faith of Jeſus:</hi> and then it ſeemes to run very largely, ſomewhat too largely, if it were only a miraculous faith, faith of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that were here intended. For I ſay unto you, whoſoever ſhall ſay unto this mountaine, be thou removed, The faith of miracles and gifts only to ſome, unto another the gift of faith; not to all, ſayes the Apoſtle. And then here 'tis oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>doubting,</hi> the ſame word that is uſed here in my text concerning <hi>Abraham,</hi> who beleeved, and ſtaggered not: ſayes he here, <hi>Whoſoever ſhall ſay to this mountaine, be thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, and be thou caſt into the ſea, and ſhall not doubt in his heart,</hi> or ſhall not ſtagger in his heart: 'tis the ſame word that is uſed there, the ſame oppoſition. So that I take it, both are here intended: one primarily, the other ſecondarily.</p>
                  <p>But now in <hi>Luke</hi> 17. there is an other occaſion, that this expreſſion is brought in by our Saviour Chriſt: he ſayes unto his diſciples, (at the third verſe) <hi>If thy brother treſpaſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee, rebuke him; if he repent, forgive him; if he treſpaſſe againſt thee ſeven times in a day, and ſeven times in a day turne againe to thee, ſaying, I repent, thou ſhalt forgive him: And the Apoſtles ſaid unto the Lord, increaſe our faith: And the Lord ſaid, if you had faith as a graine of muſtard-ſeed, you might ſay unto this Sycamine tree, &amp;c.</hi> Here is no miracle here,
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:170112:99"/>that theſe words is brought in upon: why ſhould our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our put that upon a faith of miracles, in doing a worke of Chriſtianity, the forgiving the brother ſo often thus? the faith that is to bwe exerciſed in prayer, and in forgiving our brother ordinarily, is not the faith of miracles: but the faith he here cals for, is a faith that is to be uſed in prayer, and in forgiving of our brethren: ſurely, this is a ſaving faith, a juſtifying faith that is here intended. And as one ſayes well, what's all the worke of faith, but an <hi>the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of mountaines?</hi> when take our <hi>ſins,</hi> that ſtand up and hinder the light of Gods grace from ſhining in our hearts, and remove them off from our ſelves unto Jeſus Chriſt, to his bloud, that they are drown'd, as in the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tome of that <hi>Redſes, what is this but to remove mountaines?</hi> when we take our carnall <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and our <hi>High thoughts,</hi> and bring them into obedience unto Jeſus Chirſt, <hi>what is this but to remove mountaines?</hi> when our <hi>great and manifold Temptations are</hi> laid levell, that the promiſe may come into the ſoule freely, <hi>what is this but to remove theſe mountaines? Mountaines</hi> roſe up in the way of <hi>Zerubbabell</hi> when he was to build the Temple:<note place="margin">Zach. 4.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Who art thou, O Mountaine? Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,</hi> and Corruption, <hi>Mountaines;</hi> and the <hi>Curſe of the Law, a great mountain.</hi> Would you therefore now remove theſe mountaines? walk over theſe naturall impoſſibilities? <hi>ther's no ſuch way</hi> as to get a juſtifying, and ſaving faith, ſayes our Saviour. What a bundance of Difficulties did <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ahs</hi> faith carry him through? The Lord commanded <hi>No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi> to build an Arke; <hi>Noah,</hi> he might have ſaid thus: Lord, thou haſt now commanded mee to build an <hi>Arke:</hi> I was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver brought up to that trade; I have been a preacher many yeeres, but I never yet was a Wheele-wright, never yet a Ship-<hi>Carpenter:</hi> And Lord, If I do go about to build an Arke, the whole world will jeere me: what will this old man doe? will he ride in a Ship upon the dry ground? And when I have built the Arke, Lord How ſhall I doe to get in all the Creatures into the Arke? And if the Creatures do come, they will teare me in pieces; the Lyons and the <hi>Bears</hi>
                     <pb n="199" facs="tcp:170112:99"/>they will prey upon me. Yea, Lord, And if they do come into the <hi>Arke,</hi> and into the ſhip, the very ſtench of all the beaſts will poyſon me: yet notwithſtanding all theſe Difficulties, and all theſe diſcouragements, <hi>Noah</hi> prepared an Arke, Why? For he beleeved, and he beleeved with a <hi>Saving, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifying</hi> Faith.</p>
                  <p>So, if you look into the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> that is full of this: What abundance of difficulties did the <hi>wiſe men</hi> go through that came to worſhip Jeſus Chriſt! They were commanded to go worſhip him that was borne King of the Jewes: They might have ſaid thus: What is the King of the Jewes to us? We know no ſuch King: Shall we go out of our own King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and out of our own Country to worſhip the King of the Jewes? The deſpiſed people of the Jewes? When they came at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> the <hi>learned men,</hi> the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and thoſe that were of that Country; they knew none ſuch: when they came at the <hi>place</hi> where Chriſt was borne, they found him in a Stable; and they might have ſaid: Is this the King of the Jewes? Is this his Pallace? What? A Stable for his Pallace? What? Are theſe horſe, are theſe his Courtiers? Is this a King? 'Tis impoſſible he ſhould be a King: Yet not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, they went: <hi>Why?</hi> becauſe they beleeved, <hi>and this their Faith carryed them through all.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>What abundance of difficulties did <hi>Matthewes</hi> Faith carry him through? The Lord commanded <hi>Matthew</hi> to follow him: Matthew <hi>follow me</hi> (ſayes Chriſt) and ſo he did:<note place="margin">Mat. 9 9.</note> But he might have ſaid thus: Whether ſhall I follow this man?

This is my queſtion, Faith, true, ſaving faith, it leaves the ſucceſſe and the event of things unto Chriſt, and ſo thereby the ſoule is carried through all Difficulties and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall Diſcouragements unto Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>In the fifth place. True, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> ſaving faith <hi>is that grace whereby the ſoule takes up the yoke of Chriſt, and the burden of Chriſt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſoule.</hi> Chriſts burden, does unburden all other bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, the very taking Chriſts burden upon a man, does eaſe him of all other burdens. This may ſeem ſtrange to you, that the taking of a new burden, ſhould eaſe one of the former: if a man be carrying coales or wood, the taking of a new bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den would not eaſe him of the former; but the burden of Chriſt (Belove) is of another nature. <hi>Auſtin</hi> diſtinguiſhes
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:170112:103"/>them; there is a burden <hi>burdening,</hi> and a burden ſupporting: he expreſſes it thus; The feathers that a bird or a foule is cloathed with, they have a weight in them, the wings and feathers have a weight, a pound of feathers is as heavy as a pound of lead; there is a weight in thoſe feathers, yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, they beare up the burden of the body; though there be a weight in them one weight beares up another: Or as 'tis with your coaches, the wheeles are heavy; yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, being faſtened unto the coach, unto the body of the coach, makes the body to go away the lighter, though they be heavy in themſelves, So now 'tis here, the burden of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt it makes all other burdens to go away the lighter. Faith, true, ſaving Faith, it is the grace that takes up the burden of Chriſt upon the ſoule, and ſo thereby all other burdens are made the lighter, and difficulties and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments overcome.</p>
                  <p>In the ſixt place. <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> True, ſaving faith, <hi>it does teach a man for to picke out the love of God, from under the anger of God.</hi> God never makes his Pils ſo bitter, but he mighles ſome Sugar withall: and true faith can find it out. When as our Lord and Saviour Chriſt ſaid,<note place="margin">Ioh. 2.4.5.</note> 
                     <hi>woman what have I to do with thee? mine houre is not yet come:</hi> The next words that ſhe ſaies is, to the ſervants, <hi>Whatſoever he bids you do, that do.</hi> They wanted wine, ſhe came to him for wine, and he anſwered her ſo: it may ſeem an hard anſwer, yet ſaies ſhe to the ſervants, whatſoever he bid you do, that do. For our Saviour had ſaid, my houre is not yet come: implying therfore, that he would do it. <hi>Implycation is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough for Faith, for</hi> Mary's <hi>Faith.</hi> Faith, it acquaints a man with the wayes of God, and acquaints a Soule what Gods wayes are: it tels the ſoule, that when Chriſt ſeemes to be the greateſt Enemy, he intends the greateſt friendſhip. He (ſayes faith) does then intend for to raiſe us up, when he ſeemes moſt for to caſt us downe: whereupon, when difficulties and diſcouragements do ariſe, Is this his way indeed? (ſayes a beleeving ſoule,) why then ſhall I be borne down with ſo many diſcouragements, though they be never ſo many?</p>
                  <p>In the ſeventh and laſt place: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> true ſaving juſtifying faith,
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:170112:103"/>
                     <hi>fils the ſoule with Gods infinity, or infiniteneſſe.</hi> Gods way is not as your way (ſayes Faith) nor his thoughts as your thoughts; but as the Heavens are above the earth, ſo are his thoughts beyond yours, and his wayes beyond your. Faith lodges this principle into the Soule, that God is infinite; and having laid that principle there, when difficulties and diſcouragements do ariſe, ſaying, you ſee now into what diſtreſſe you are brought, now you ſee there is no hope at all for you deliverance; true indeed, ſayes the Beleever through the ſtrength of Faith, I ſee there is no way in any one reaſon, but God is infinite; I ſee many difficulties, but God is infinite: the ſoule by Faith being fild with the apprehenſion of Gods infiniteneſſe, here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by is carried through all difficulties and diſcouragements to Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>I have not time, I ſee, to tell you how Faith workes by love, which much watter cannot quench, ſtronger then death. And how Faith is ſtrengthened with the ſtrength of the power of God that it layes hold upon. As the Ivie is ſtrong by the ſtrength of the oake that it graſpes upon: ſo Faith is ſtrong by the ſtrength of that God that it graſpes upon.</p>
                  <p>But the thing is ſufficiently proved, <hi>No difficultie can ſtand before ſaving Faith; True, ſaving, juſtifying Faith, carries the Soule through all difficulties, diſcouragements, and naturall Impoſſibilities to Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come to the <hi>Application.</hi>

                  <p>If a man be to go home over ſome water, or River, and the water riſes, he ſayes with himſelf, how ſhall I get over this water?

So I ſay, does difficulty, or diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment break in upon your duty? Morning duty? Evening duty? Or any grace? Follow after it: if thou ſtrikeſt this difficulty in the hinder part, and recovereſt thy duty, or thy grace out of the hand of the difficulty, thy duty and thy grace will be more comfortable then ever it was.</p>
                  <p>And then in the Fift place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/>

And know this, that difficulties do ſometimes ariſe in our way, to make a ſtoppage in our proceedings: and ſometimes they ariſe onely to draw out our faith.

                     <hi>That the more you beleeve in the face of difficulty, the more you pleaſe God.</hi> Nothing ſo pleaſing to God, as beleeving in the face of difficulty. God will truſt him with much, that truſts much to God: God will break through many difficulties to ſave thy ſoule, if thou canſt break through many difficulties to come to him. There's no grace does more honour God, then Faith; of all graces it honours God moſt: and of all the pieces of faith, none doe more honour God, then beleeving in the face of difficulties. When therefore any difficulty or naturall diſcouragement does ariſe, ſay, the Lord pardon mee; Oh! I have diſhonou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red God enough already: is this the way for to honour God, to beleeve in the face of difficulties, and naturall diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?

Onely I pray take heed, when ye ſpeake of your experiences, and what God hath done, that ye don't lay, or ground your Faith upon your experience, but upon the promiſe. 'Tis a good ſpeech that <hi>Pariſienſis</hi> hath, <hi>Experience</hi> (ſayes he) <hi>'Tis like the crutch, the lame mans crutch, it does uphold the lame man, but it don't cure him:</hi> And ſo, an experience, it ſtayes up thy ſoule for the preſent, but experience cannot cure you of your unbeliefe; 'tis onely the promiſe cures you of your unbeliefe. 'Tis ſaid in the 106.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words, are the words of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> when he firſt began to preach the Goſpel of Chriſt; and if ye look into the next Chapter, the 4. of <hi>Matth.</hi> and the 17. verſ. ye ſhal find, That our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt Himſelf does preach the ſame Doctrine, in the ſame words, <hi>Jeſus began to preach, and to ſay, Repent, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Our Savionr Chriſt, the better preacher, is not aſhamed to tread in <hi>Johns</hi> ſteps, and words: <hi>John</hi> honored Chriſt, and Chriſt honored <hi>John.</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters ſhould ſtrengthen the hands one of anoter. And if ye look into the 10. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ye ſhall finde,
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:170112:108"/>That when our Saviour ſent out his Diſciples for to Preach the Goſpel, he commands them to preach the ſame Doctrin too, in the ſame words (verſe the 7.) <hi>Go ye, preach, ſaying; The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> But here's no, <hi>Repent?</hi> Yes, that was in their Commiſſion too, as ye may reade in the 6. of <hi>Mark</hi> and the 12. verſe (they would not preach a word beyond their Commiſſion) <hi>And they went out, and preached that men ſhould Repent.</hi> So that their Commiſſion alſo was to preach thus, Repent, for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath approached, or hath drawn neer unto you. Surely, there is ſomewhat more than ordinary in theſe words, That <hi>John</hi> and our Saviour Chriſt, and all the Diſciples ſhould begin thus, for to preach in theſe words, <hi>Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> They were all Miniſters of the Goſpel: and the Miniſters of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, are not barely to preach Repentance, but they are to preach Repentance upon Goſpel Motives, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</p>
                  <p>In the words ye have an Exhortation, <hi>Repent ye:</hi> A Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive unto the work of Repentance, <hi>for the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hath approached.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repent ye</hi>] That is, be not only ſorrowfull for ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, but mend your lives. Repentance is ſometimes taken in a large ſence for Amendment of life. Sometimes Repentance is taken only for Godly ſorrow, in a more ſtrict, and a narrow ſence.</p>
                  <p>Somtimes it is taken largely, For the <hi>Amendment of our life:</hi> not only for godly ſorrow, but all obedience, and reformation. And ſo it may be taken here; as ye may per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive by the 3. verſ. where this word, Repent, is explain'd, <hi>Repent ye, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand; for this is He that was ſpoken of by the Prophet</hi> Eſaias, <hi>ſaying, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtreight.</hi> Preparing the way of the Lord, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king ſtreight paths, all one with Repentace. There is a <hi>Iegal</hi> Repentance: And there is an <hi>Evangelical</hi> Repentance. Some think it is a <hi>Legal</hi> Repentance that is here required;
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:170112:108"/>and there upon they urge a neceſſity of Legal preparation before a man does come to Chriſt: as there is a <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> before Chriſt; ſo (ſay they) there muſt be a <hi>Legal</hi> work of neceſſity before a poor ſoul can have any admittance to Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But I pray conſider the words, and you will find; That not a <hi>Legal</hi> repentance; but <hi>Evangelical</hi> is here required. Did our Savior Chriſt Himſelf preach Legal Repentance? They are the words of our Savior Chriſt; He uſes them too.</p>
                  <p>The Repentace is, as the Conſideration is that this work is to be founded on, as the motive is. What's the motive? The Kindom of Heavcn is at hand, Repent; let your Repentance be upon this ground, becauſe the King-dom of Heaven hath approach't, becauſe the Kingdom of Heaven hath drawn neer. He does not ſay, Repent, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Kingdom of <hi>Hell</hi> is neer, but becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven is neer: the Motive being <hi>Evangelical,</hi> the Repentance is ſo, 'tis not a <hi>Legall,</hi> but an <hi>Evangelieal</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance that is here required. Beſidesw theſe words, <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand,</hi> are not ſpoken only to the ungodly, but unto the godly alſo of thoſe times who were to prepare the way of the Lord, and to make ſtreight their pathes. And therefore, not to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood of a Repentance only preparatory to that in the heart.</p>
                  <p>But what then are we to underſtand here by the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven? <label type="milestone">

                  <p>The Kingom of Heaven ſometimes in the language of the <hi>new Teſtament</hi> Notes, <label type="milestone">

                     </label> The glorious condition of the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther world that we are going to. Sometimes it notes the State of the Church; it's uſed for the Church of Chriſt. And ſometimes for the Goſpel of Chriſt. I take it here for the whole State of the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> the Kingdom of grace, Chriſt, and all his benefits, grace, mercy, and free remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170112:109"/>publiſhed in the Goſpel, in the ſeveral diſpenſations, and adminiſtrations thereof: this is called the Kingdom of Heaven, for this motive, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, is ſet and uſed here in oppoſition unto the motives that was uſed among the Jewes: when the Jewes were Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited, and put upon any duty, they were ſtirred up there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto upon ſuch motives as theſe: for the Kingdom of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan</hi> is at hand; If you do ſo and ſo, God will bring you into the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> and give you that Land. Now under the Goſpel, here are other motives, Repent, for the Kingdom of <hi>Heaven</hi> is at hand: Not like thoſe Jewiſh mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, The kingdom of <hi>Canaan</hi> is at hand, or the Kingdom of the <hi>Jebuſites</hi> is at hand; Chriſtians are not only or eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to be ſtir'd up by ſuch motives as thoſe, but by high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and greater motives, Repent, for the Kingdom of <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> is at hadn. And may carry an <hi>Hebraiſme</hi> with it, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> that is, a heavenly Kingdom: as the Law is called the Law <hi>of fire,</hi> in the Hebrew, a fiery Law. The Jews expected the Meſſiah, &amp; dream'd of an outward, glourious, and pompous Kindgom: Now ſaies <hi>John</hi> the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſt, The Meſſiah is come, his Kingdom is come; but it is not an outward, glorious, and pompous Kingdom; but 'tis an heavenly Kingdom, and therefore, Repent, and prepare your ſelves for the receiving of it, make your way plaine, for the Kingdom of Heaven, an heavenly Kingdom is now at hand.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Is at hand</hi>] we reade it; but according to the original rather thus, <hi>The Kingdome of Heaven hath approch'd, Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinquavit:</hi> As if he ſhould ſay thus, Do you turn to God, becauſe God hath turned to you: do you draw neer to God, becauſe the kingdom of grace, and free-remiſſion hath drawn neer to you.</p>
                  <p>There are Two Notes that lie here before us, that I ſhall commend unto your conſideration.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is this, <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven, of Grace, Mercy, and of free-remiſſion does approach unto us before we do come unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="tcp:170112:109"/>
                  <p>And Secondly, <hi>That the appropinquation, or drawing neer of the Kingdom of Heaven, is the higheſt, and greateſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and motive in the world unto true repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven,</hi> (I ſay) <hi>the Kingdom of Grace, Mercy, and Free-remiſſion of ſin, does appreach to us, before we draw neer to it.</hi> Repent, turn ye; for the Kingdom of Heaven hath approached, or it hath come to you, and therefore do you come to it.</p>
                  <p>Thus it lies in the words: And thus you will find it all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a-long.</p>
                  <p>Thus God hath <hi>promiſed:</hi> This Chriſt hath <hi>parabled:</hi> Thus God <hi>fulfilled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus God hath <hi>promiſed.</hi> Thou ſhalt hear a voice be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind thee: What voice is that? but the voice of mercy, and the voice of grace, and of free-remiſſion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thou ſhalt hear a voice behind thee:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30.21.</note> When thou art going away from God, and when thou haſt thy back upon God; thou ſhalt hear a voice of mercy behind thee; it ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after thee before thou doſt come to it.</p>
                  <p>And thus ye have a cleer <hi>parable</hi> for it, which you may reade, fully ſpeaking this truth, in <hi>Luke</hi> 14.16, 17, 18. and ſo on, <hi>A certain man made a great ſupper, and bade many; And ſent his ſervant at Supper-time, to ſay to them that were bidden, Come, for all things are now ready. And they all with one con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent began to make extuſes: So that the Servant came</hi> (at the 21. verſ.) <hi>and ſhewed his Lord theſe things. Then the Maſter of the houſe being angry, ſaid to his Servant, Go quiekly into the Streets and Lanes of the City, and bring in hither the poor, and the maimed; and the balt, and the blind.</hi> (Mark) here are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitations of mercy ſent out to thoſe that never thought of it. <hi>And the Servant ſaid, Lord, it is done as thou baſt comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and yet there is room. And the Lord ſaid unto the Servant again</hi> (at the 23. verſ.) <hi>Go out into the high-wayes, and beages, and compel them to come in, that my houſe may be filled.</hi> See I pray, how the kingdom of Grace, and Mercy, and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiſſion
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170112:110"/>is broughe neer unto a people, before ever they did make after it.</p>
                  <p>And this (I ſay) you ſhall find <hi>fulfilled.</hi> So God hath dealt by the world. So by particular <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> and <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> in the world. So by particular <hi>Towns,</hi> and <hi>Countries</hi> in a Kingdom. So by particular <hi>Families</hi> in a Towne. And ſo by particular <hi>perſons</hi> in a family.</p>
                  <p>Thus God hath dealt with the <hi>World,</hi> He hath brought neer the Kingdom of Grace, and Mercy, and free-remiſſion to the World, before ever the World did make after it. When the whol World had ſinned in the fall, and lay in wickedneſs, and never thought of returning unto God; <hi>God ſo loved the world,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16</note> 
                     <hi>that he ſent his only begotten Son to them.</hi> When <hi>Adam</hi> did not think of Chriſt, nor the world in him; the Lord gives out a promiſe, <hi>The Seed of the Woman ſhall break the Serpents head.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15</note> Thus mercy, and grace made it's approach towards the world, before ever the world did ſeek after it.</p>
                  <p>So in regard of a <hi>Nation,</hi> in regard of a <hi>Kingdome</hi> in the world: <hi>Go</hi> (ſaies our Lord and Savior Chriſt unto his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) <hi>and teach all Nations.</hi> The Nations did not come to Chriſt and ſay, Lord, the Jewes have refuſed the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and therefore we beſeech thee that the Goſpel may be preached unto us, and we will receive it: No, but before ever they ſent any ſuch meſſage to have the Goſpel come down to them, the Goſpel is ſent to them, <hi>Go</hi> (ſaies our Savior) <hi>Go preach to all Nations.</hi> But Lord (they might ſay) Suppoſe that in thoſe nations we meet with ſuch a man as <hi>Herod,</hi> ſuch a man as <hi>Pilate;</hi> ſhall we preach the Goſpel, and free remiſſion of ſins then to ſuch a one? Go (ſaies Chriſt,) I make no exceptions; Go, and preach to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But ſuppoſe that a <hi>Judas</hi> come in when we are prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the Goſpel. Saies Chriſt, I make no exceptions, if a <hi>Judas</hi> will come and ſubmit, Goe, preach to all, Goe preach the Goſpel, Go preach to all Nations.</p>
                  <p>And was it not thus with the Nation of the <hi>Jewes,</hi> as ye reade in the 16. Chapter of the Propheſie of <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> when
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170112:110"/>they were firſt taken into Gods love? <hi>None eye pitied thee,</hi> (at the 5. verſe) <hi>to do any of theſe unto thee, to have compaſſion on thee.</hi> Verſe the 6. <hi>When I paſſed by thee, and ſaw thee polluted in tlsine own blood, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, Live: yea, I ſaid unto thee when thou waſt in thy blood, Live.</hi> And ſo it will be with this people the Jews again, when they ſhall be converted in the latter daies of the world: The Lord ſpeaks ſo concerning them by the Prophet <hi>Eſay: I was found of thoſe that ſought me not.</hi> And in the 66.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 65.1</note> Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Eſay</hi> and the 7. verſe, 'tis ſaid concerning the Jewes that are yet to be called, and the preventing love of God towards them: <hi>Before ſhe travailed, ſhe brought forth: before her pain came, ſhe was delivered of a man-child.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it is alſo with particular <hi>Towns</hi> in a Kingdom, or in a Nation: the kingdom of grace, of heaven is brought neer to them before they do ſeek to it. The Apoſtles went &amp; preach't unto ſeveral Towns; <hi>Iconium,</hi> &amp; <hi>Derbe,</hi> &amp; <hi>Lyſtra;</hi> before thoſe Towns did call for the Goſpel. And if you look into the 4. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> you find, <hi>That our Saviour Chriſt came and dwelt in Capernaum</hi> (at the 13 verſe) <hi>which is upon the ſea-coaſt, in the borders of Zabulon and Naph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tali: That it might be-ful filled which was ſpoken by Eſaias the Prophet, ſaying, The Land of Zabulon, and the Land of Nephta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li, by the way of the Sea beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles: The people which ſate in darkneſs, ſaw great light: and to them which ſate in the region and ſhadow of death, light is ſorung up.</hi> While they were ſitting ſtill in their ſins, and in the very ſhadow of death, Chriſt goes among them, and cauſes a glorious light to ſhine upon them: they did not go out to the light, but the light did come out to them firſt.</p>
                  <p>So 'tis alſo in regard of a particular <hi>Family</hi> in a Town: 'tis ſaid concerning the <hi>Jailors</hi> family, that they were all baptized, they all beleeved: but how? did the Jailors family come and ſeek after the Kingdom of Heaven, before the Kingdom of Heaven was brought unto them? No, The Apoſtles, were brought into priſon, God works a miracle; the Kingdom of Heaven, grace, and free remiſſion is
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170112:111"/>brought to the priſon, and is brought to the Jaylors fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, before ever the Jailor did ſtir after it.</p>
                  <p>And ſo ye know it was with the family of <hi>Zacheus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luke,</hi> 19 9.</note> 
                     <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> (ſaies our Saviour) <hi>This day is ſalvation come to thine houſe.</hi> Pray conſider it a little, did <hi>Zacheus's</hi> houſe go to ſeek for ſalvation? or rather, did not ſalvation come and ſeek for <hi>Zecheus's</hi> houſe? Indeed <hi>Zecheus</hi> out of a curioſity ran and got up into a tree that he might ſee the out-ſide of Jeſus Chriſt: but our Lord and Saviour Chriſt, cals him down, <hi>Zacheus</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>I muſt dine with thee:</hi> invites him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he carries ſalvation unto his family.</p>
                  <p>Thus God deals by <hi>Families:</hi> He deals thus by the <hi>World,</hi> He deals thus by <hi>Nations,</hi> He deals thus by <hi>Towns,</hi> He deals thus by <hi>Families.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And he deals thus by particular <hi>Perſons</hi> alſo: Was it not thus with <hi>Matthew</hi> the Publican? He ſate (ye know) in his Cuſtome-houſe, and Chriſt came and found him out there; he did not firſt go and ſeek after Chriſt, but Chriſt came firſt unto him, and found him out in his trade, and ſaid unto him,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.13.</note> follow me. And was it not thus with <hi>Paul?</hi> Saies <hi>Paul, I was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor: But I obtained mercy.</hi> I was breathing out threatenings againſt the Saints, and againſt the Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt: but as I was breathing out threatenings againſt them, the holy Ghoſt breath'd upon my heart, and met me in the way, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſt me, and ſhowed me mercy: the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven did approach unto <hi>Paul,</hi> before ever <hi>Paul</hi> ſought after it.</p>
                  <p>And as 'tis with a particular Perſon in regard of his <hi>firſt Converſion,</hi> and <hi>firſt Repentance:</hi> So in regard of his <hi>After-Repentance: Peter</hi> ſins, and before ever <hi>Peter</hi> repents, Chriſt looks back upon him; that is the firſt, then <hi>Peter</hi> wept bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly. <hi>Johah</hi> ſin'd, and ſin'd greatly in running away from God: before ever <hi>Johah</hi> could find in his heart, for to ſeek unto God, God works a miracle: provides a cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of preſervation, even in the belly of deſtruction, in the Whales-belly for him. God brought neer his pardoning
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:170112:111"/>mercy, and grace to him, before ever <hi>Jonah</hi> came neer to it.</p>
                  <p>And as 'tis in regard of a mans firſt, ſecond, and after Prepentance: So 'tis alſo in regardof a mans <hi>Comfort,</hi> and <hi>Conſolation.</hi> O Lord, (ſaies <hi>David</hi>) <hi>Make me to receive joy,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8. <hi>Pſa.</hi> 77.2</note> 
                     <hi>and comfort; that the bones that thou haſt broken may rejoyce: My ſoul refuſeth comfort,</hi> (ſaies he) As if he ſhould ſay thus: Lord, I have been a great Surgeon at other mens hearts, and I have been able to ſet their bones that have been out of joynt: but now mine own bones are broken; I have fallen greatly, and now my own bones are broken, I cannot ſet mine own bones; My ſoul refuſeth comfort, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe is to my heart-like a bank of Ice, that my heart ſlips off: and Lord, if thou doeſt not uphold my heart with a promiſe, I ſhall never have comfort: Make me to ſee comfort, O Lord.</p>
                  <p>Thus you ſee, where ever you look in the Scripture, 'tis full of the truth that is here before us, namely, That the Kingdome of Heaven, grace, mercy, and free-remiſſion does approach unto us before we draw neer to it.</p>
                  <p>Evidences of it.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, <hi>Taken from our own Condition:</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> Naturally we are loſt ſheep; ſo we are called by Chriſt. Man, in his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſtate, is compared unto the loſt ſon, the loſt groat, and the loſt ſheep. Now you know when a ſheep is loſt, it does not lie where it is loſt: if you loſe your <hi>purſe,</hi> or if you loſe a <hi>ring,</hi> it will lie where it was loſt unleſs it be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken up: but now, if a ſheep be loſt, the ſheep wanders up and down, and doth not lie where it was loſt, but wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders up and down over one mountain to another, through one thicket to another, through one dirty place to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: and of all creatures, the loſt ſheep does not ſeek the way home again: A dog loſt will ſeek the way home again; a Cat, and ſuch like creatures loſt, will ſeek the way home again: but a ſheep loſt, does not ſeek the way home again. Now we are all loſt ſheep, wandring up and down: One, he wanders over the mountain of <hi>Pride:</hi> another through
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:170112:112"/>the thicket of the <hi>World:</hi> another through ſome unclean <hi>Slough:</hi> but all wandring, and no man able to find his home, till he be firſt found. Therefore ſaies our Saviour Chriſt,<note place="margin">

And truely, we muſt be ſought all along.

                  <p>A Second Evidence, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>I take from Chriſts willingneſs for to ſave ſinners.</hi> There is an infinite willingneſs in our dear Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour for to ſave poor ſinners. He came from Heaven for that end and purpoſe: If a man come a thouſand miles up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a buſineſs; will ye not think he is willing to do it? Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt came from Heaven for this buſineſs, for to ſave ſinners; Is He not then willing to do it? I may ſay that Jeſus Chriſt is more willing to ſave ſinners, than ſinners are to be ſaved by him. The Prodigal goes home to his father; but when the father ſees him after off, he runs: the Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal goes, and the father runs to meet him with mercy.</p>
                  <p>Yea, and our Savior Chriſt ſeems to be moſt willing to ſave the greateſt ſinners: the greateſt Saints have bin made up out of the greateſt ſinners. When the Lord Jeſus Chriſt was upon the earth, did he not carry his grace, and mercy, and the doctrin of free remiſſion to the greateſt fine<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>rs? Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, conſider of it I pray you, The greater the ſinner is, the more is Chriſt honored in getting out his Pardon, and in ſatisfying for ſuch a finner, and ſo he will love Chriſt the more. Look I pray into the 7 Chap. of <hi>Luke, Simon</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>I'le propound thee a parable. Maſter, ſay on</hi> (ſaies he) Then ſaies, our Savior (at the 41 verſ) <hi>There was be certain Creditor, that had two Dobters; the one ought five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:170112:112"/>pence, and the other fifty: And when they had nothing to pay, he frankly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him moſt?</hi> Simon <hi>anſwered and ſaid, I ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt. And he ſaid unto him, thou haſt rightly judged.</hi> Thoſe that he forgives moſt unto, will love moſt. Jeſus Chriſt loves to be greatly honored, and loved, and therefore he is willing to ſave the greateſt ſinners. But now, the greateſt ſinners are moſt oppoſit unto what is good, they don't ſeek after what is good: Surely therefore, if Jeſus Chriſt would ſave ſinners, and the greateſt ſinners; of neceſſity the Kingdome of Heaven, and of Grace, muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto us, before we draw neer to it.</p>

                  <p>I beſeech you turn unto the place where the Scripture lies: 'tis in the 9. Chapter of <hi>Matthew</hi> at the latter end of the 13. verſe. <hi>I am not come to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance.</hi> This (ſay I) is not to be underſtood of ſinners only <hi>Senſible</hi> of their own ſins, but ſinners <hi>indeed.</hi> Chriſt came to call ſinners <hi>indeed,</hi> yea, before they are <hi>ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible</hi> of their ſins. For the word (Sinner) here, muſt be underſtood as the word ſinner before is, in the 10. and 11. verſe, <hi>As Jeſus ſate at meat in the houſe, behold, many Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and ſinners came and ſate down with him, and with his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. When the Phariſees ſaw it, they ſaid unto his Diſciples, why eateth your Maſter with Publicans and ſinners?</hi> He did eat with thoſe that were not ſenſible of their ſins: Sinners there, are not to be meant of thoſe only that were ſenſible of their ſins; Chriſt did not only eat with thoſe that were ſenſible of their ſins. Now he gives this account of it, <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners to repentance:</hi> That is, ſinners, ſuch as he names before, ſuch as he did eat withal; and they were not only ſuch as were ſenſible of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>Again, Our Saviour Chriſt gives this account, at the 12. verſe, <hi>The whole need not the Phyſitian, but thoſe that are ſick.</hi> To anſwer to this Objection, That our Saviour did eat with ſinners, and converſe with ſinners. Saies he, I am a Phyſitian; and Phyſitians, are to go to thoſe that are ſick only. There is this difference between me a Phyſitian, and other Phyſitians: for I come unſent for; but other Phyſitians come when ſent for. I, as a Phyſitian come to Cal my Patients: but other Phyſitians are Called in by their Patients. Now (ſaies he) I am a Phyſitian, and I come not to call the righteous, but ſinners, I come to Call my
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:170112:113"/>Pationts. Phyſitians don't only go to thoſe that are ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of their diſeaſe; but if a man be paſt ſence, his friends ſend for the Phyſitians, and the Phyſitian goes: So does Chriſt here, Comes unto his Patients when they are not ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their diſeaſe many times.</p>
                  <p>Again; This ſutes with that which goes before. <hi>Go</hi> (ſaies he, at the 13 verſe) <hi>and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not ſaerifice.</hi> Sometimes this phraſe, this ſentence is to be underſtood concerning bodily mercy: But here 'tis to be underſtood of mercy to the ſoule <hi>Go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice.</hi> Ye object to me, that I converſe with Publicans and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, not with thoſe that are righteous in their generation, go and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not ſacrifice: I have more delight in converſing with poor ſinners, that with thoſe Jews that do offer ſacrifice.</p>
                  <p>Ang again, Gonſider what ſenſe would here be, if this ſhould be the meaning; <hi>I came not to call the righteous, but ſinners:</hi> That is, I came to call thoſe that are ſenſible of their ſins, Then the meaning muſt be this: I came not to call the righteous, but men that are penitent, men that are ſenſible of their ſins, and are penitent. If by the cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the ſinners we are to underſtand thoſe that are ſenſible only; then the ſenſe muſt be this, I came not to call the righteous, but men that are penitent. No, no, Chriſt came to cal ſinners, poor ſinners; although they were never yet ſenſible of their ſins, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt came to call ſinners, which are ſo indeed.</p>

                     <hi>He juſtifies the ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> not in their ſins, but from their ſins, through Chriſt. 'Tis not in Gods love, as in our love: you love, becauſe the thing loved is lovely: but Gods love, does make love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: your love finds lovely: and Gods love makes lovely. You love a perſon becauſe of ſome beauty: but Gods love does make beautiful. You love a perſon becauſe of ſome good you do find before you love: but Gods love brings the goodneſs with it, Gods love makes the perſon good that he does love.

The ſight of Gods grace, wil make a man gractions: the more ye ſee the grace of God in Chriſt, the more gractious ye wil be. And pray mark that inſtance which ye have in the 7. of <hi>Luke:</hi> (the ſame that Inamed before) conſider it well,
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:170112:115"/>at the 37. verſe, <hi>Behold, a woman in the City which was a ſinner</hi> (it ſeems ſhe was a very wicked woman, a ſinner) <hi>when ſhe knew that Jeſus Chriſt ſate at meat in the Phariſees houſe, brought an Alabaſter box of ointment, and ſtood at his feet behind him wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, and began to waſh his ſeet with teares, and did wipe them with the haires of her head, and kiſſed his feet, and anointed them with the ointment.</hi> What's the reaſon of this? Saies our Saviour Chriſt, I ſay unto thee, (at the 47. verſe) <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven her, for ſhe loved much.</hi> She wept much, becauſe ſhe loved much: and ſhe loved much, becauſe much was forgiven her.</p>
                  <p>The Papiſts and thoſe that do follow them ſay indeed, That her forgiveneſs was a fruit of her love: becauſe 'tis ſaid here, <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> But good people makr it, and you-will find, that firſt of all there is forgivenſs, and thereupon the woman loved: and her loving much, was but a ſign of her being much forgiven. For this is ſutable with the latter end of the 47. verſe: <hi>Her ſins, which are many, are forgiven, for ſhe loved much.</hi> Much forgivenſs is the ground of loving much: and loving much, is a fign of much forgiveneſs: for it follows, But to whom little is forgiven, the ſame loveth little.</p>
                  <p>And this ſutes alſo with the Parable that ye have before, at the 41. and the 42. and the 43. verſes. (Which is brought in upon occaſion of this womans loving thus much.) <hi>A cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Creditor had two debtors: the one ought five hundred pence, and the other fifty: and when they had nothing to pay, he frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forgave them both. Tell me therefore, which of them will love him moſt?</hi> Simon <hi>anſwered and ſaid, I ſuppoſe that he to whom he forgave moſt.</hi> Marke the ſcope of the parable, and you will find it is to ſhow, That love flows from forgiveneſs. The Papiſts, (and others that cleave to them) therefore, go againſt the ſcope of this Parable.</p>
                  <p>And now my beloved, if all our love be upon forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and forgiveneſs goes firſt; Oh! what free-grace is here? We Repent, and we Weep becauſe we love; and we
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170112:115"/>love becauſe we are forgiven: but forgiveneſs goes firſt: Oh! what grace! and love is here! <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo taken with this, that to me he ſeems to be more taken with it, than with the viſion that he had in the third Heaven, ſaies he, <hi>I knew a man (whether in the body,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.2.</note> 
                     <hi>or out of the body) a man</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>wrapt up into the third Heaven, and heard unſpeaka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble words, which is not lawful to be uttered.</hi> And this <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of but once. But ſaies <hi>Paul, I was a blaſphenter,</hi>

                     <hi>I was a perſecutor; but I obtained mercy:</hi> This ſtory he tels three times: he tels the other ſtory but one time; but this ſtory, this ſtory of free grace; how he was a blaſphemer, and a perſecutor, and how he obtain'd mercy; this was never out of his mind. As if he were more refreſh't with the thought of this, than with the other. And I pray what then? Do but obſerve <hi>Paul,</hi> who <hi>gracious</hi> he is: how <hi>humble</hi> he is: how <hi>thankful</hi> he is: how ready to <hi>ſerve</hi> Chriſt: how ready to <hi>ſerve</hi> the Churches for Chriſt: how ready to <hi>ſuffer</hi> for Chriſt upon all occaſions: Oh! how gracious did this make him. Thus 'tis with a poor ſoul, that hath taſted of the free-grace of God in Chriſt; the heart is more taken herewithal, than with the thoughts of Heaven: Ah, ſaies a poor ſoul, I was going on in ſuch a ſinful way; or I lay ſleeping and ſnorting in my ſins; and I know not how, before ever I was aware, the Kingdom of Heaven did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto me, and the Lord in his free-grace ſhowed mercy to my family, and to my poor ſoul: Oh! therefore, any thing for Jeſus Chriſt; Oh! I will ſpend, and be ſpent, Oh! any thing for Jeſus Chriſt. The ſight of Gods grace, does make one gracious; and therefore Chriſt does take this way, Cauſing the Kingdom of Heaven, grace, and free remiſſion, to approach firſt unto us, before we do draw neer to it.</p>
                  <p>There is one Reaſon more, I will but name it.</p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="Rea." n="3"/>
                  <p>Chriſt does ſo order things in the diſpenſations of his grace, that no fleſh might glory in it ſelfe, or in any thing that it hath, or doth: that no fleſh might reſt in any duty, in any ſervice, in any ſuffering; but only upon grace, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170112:116"/>Chriſt alone. Beloved! we are very unwilling to come unto any duty; and when we have done, we are then as apt to reſt upon it, as ever we were unwilling to come unto it. But what's the reaſon that men are ſo apt to reſt upon their duties, but becauſe there are theſe ſecret thoughts, that they come to Chriſt, before he does come to them. Let the heart be poſſeſt with this truth, That Jeſus Chriſt, and the Kingdom of Heaven, and of free-grace, does approach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and come neer to us, before we draw neer to it. And then he will not reſt ſo much upon what he is, doth, or ſuffereth. A man in this caſe is like unto a Silk-worme; you know how 'tis with that worme: it makes a fine web, a fine work; and when it hath done, it dies in it, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it eats a hole through the work, and it comes out with wings, a quite other creature than it went into it. So it is with a poor Chriſtian: he makes a fine work of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and then he dies in it; but through the manifeſtations of Gods free grace, he does, as it were, eat a hole through all, and he comes out with wings flying away from his du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, not ſo as to neglect the performance of them, but ſo, as not to reſt upon them: flyes away from (in regard of reſting upon any) duty; and only upon this ground, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe (ſaies he) God did draw neer to me, grace did draw neer to me, mercy did draw neer to me, before ever I drew neer to it: and therefore why ſhould I reſt upon any duty, performe it I will, but through grace I will not reſt upon it.</p>

                     </note> Let us I pray conſider with our ſelves, whether God hath dealt thus by our ſouls or no: Hath the Kingdom of Heaven approch't, and drawn neer unto us, before we drew neer to it? if not, truly (for ought that I know) we are yet under the Law: and all our mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and walkings Heaven-ward, they are but Legal: If God love you indeed, He ſhews kindneſs, and mercy to you, before you do come to him.</p>

<pb n="233" facs="tcp:170112:116"/>You have ſome men take a great deal of pains, riſe early, and go to bed late, and yet the world does not ſmile upon them: theſe are the world's enemies. Some take pains, and grow rich thereby; theſe are the worlds friends, Others there are again, that before ever they take any pains the Lord is upon them with the worlds bleſſings; theſe are the worlds darlings. So I ſay, God hath his darlings; and if thou art one of Gods darlings, He does cauſe the Kingdom of Heaven, Grace, and Free-remiſſion to appear and draw neer unto thy ſoul, even before thou doſt draw neer to it. Hath God dealt thus by any of you? Oh! con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, conſider ſeriouſly the ſweetneſs of this grace. Beloved! preventing grace, is ſweet grace.

'Tis a great matter, that the great God of Heaven and Earth ſhould anſwer our prayers, give us any mercy upon our requeſt: I, but that the Lord ſhould give us the greateſt mercie before we come for it. Pray good people mark it a little, Ye ſhall obſerve, that the greateſt mercies that ye have; ye have them, and they are given unto you before you come for them. There are ſome great mercies that a Chriſtian hath: as <hi>Converſion</hi> of his ſoul, <hi>Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Remiſſion</hi> of ſin: Some leſſer mercies; as <hi>comfort,</hi> and peace, and outward <hi>plenty.</hi> As for theſe leſſer mercies, God gives them when we do come for them: but as for the great Mercies; <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of ſin; <hi>Juſtification</hi> of our perſons; <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> of our ſouls, God is upon us with theſe mercies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we come for them: Oh! what grace is here!

                  <p>Some there are, that doubt of their ſalvation, becauſe of the lgnorance that is in them: darkneſs cauſes fear: they don't know the mercifull diſpoſition of Jeſus Chriſt, and ſo they doubt of his love.

But beloved, ye have heard of the merciful, ſweet diſpoſition of Jeſus Chriſt: he is willing to ſave ſinners, and the greateſt ſinners; brings neer the Kingdom of Heaven to us, before we draw neer to it: Oh! wilt thou doubt again? poor Chriſtian, wilt thou doubt again?</p>
                  <p>Some there are, that doubt of their ſalvation, becauſe they are afraid their duties ſhall not be accepted, prayers ſhall not be accepted: Oh! if I could but be perſwaded (ſaies one) that the Lord would hear my prayer, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of my duty, then I ſhould know indeed I ſhould be ſaved: but I am afraid the Lord doth not hear my prayers, and accept of my duties; and therefore I fear I ſhall not be ſaved. Man or woman, where ever thou ſtandſt, or art; hear the Word of the Lord. Does the Lord cauſe the Kingdom of Heaven to approach and draw neer to us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we draw neer to it? will the Lord be found of thoſe that ſeek him not? and will he not be found of you that do ſeek him? Will the Lord come with his grace, and make an offer of grace, and mercy to a ſinner, and a great ſinner? and will not the Lord receive you, when you do come unto him? Think of this: and ſurely then you will ſay, Doub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſhall be no more.</p>
                  <p>Some there are, that doubt of their ſalveation, becauſe they cannot pray; their hearts are dead: pray I cannot, and hear I cannot, and reade I cannot, performe duty I

Well, but though you cannot, Man, or Woman, Chriſtian; pray as thou art able, and hear as thou art able, and reade as thou art able: the Lord Chriſt is of this ſweet diſpoſition, That. he does canſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven to draw neer to us, before we draw neer to it: Oh! therefore, you that are the ſervants of the Lord, Truſt in the Lord for ever; for ever truſt in the Lord: and let doubting be no more.</p>
                  <p>I conclude all with one word of Exhortation,<note place="margin">Applic. <hi>2</hi>
                     </note> and it is unto thoſe that have not yet ſubmitted unto this Kingdom of Heaven, this Kingdom of Grace: Is there a truth in this Doctrine? That the Kingdom of Heaven, grace, mercy, and free remiſſion, does approach unto us, before we draw neer unto it? and that becauſe (indeed) we are not able to draw neer to it, before it draws neer unto us? Then all you, that have not yet ſubmitted unto this Kingdom of grace, and the offer of grace, and mercy in the Goſpel: when ever any offer ſhall be made unto ye, take heed that ye neglect not ſo great ſalvation. You ſee how 'tis with the ſea-man: becauſe the ſea-man is not able to raiſe a wind; or turn the wind when 'tis raiſed; he lies upon the ſea-coaſt ready, waiting upon the wind: and when the wind turns, then he hoiſts up his ſailes, for ſaies he, now the wind is come about, and if I loſe this gale, I am like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to loſe my voyage: I cannot turn the wind, I cannot make the wind. So I ſay to you, man or woman, young man, or old; hath the Lord brought a gale upon thine heart at any time? a gale of mercy, made a tender of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and free remiſſion to thee? Oh! for the love of God, and of thy own ſoul, take heed how you loſe this opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: is the wind come about? (the Spirit blows where it liſteth:) is the wind come about? Up with thy ſailes, up with thy ſailes, take heed how you loſe this opportunity that now you have. Little do you think, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven may be in ſuch a motion as you deſpiſe: the Kingdom of Heaven may be knocking at your door, the
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:170112:119"/>door of your heart, by ſuch a hand as you little think of. <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of muſterd-ſeed,</hi>

                     <hi>which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds; but it grows to that bigneſs, that the fowles of the aire come and make there their neſts:</hi> When you ſee a little muſterd-ſeed, you will ſay, 'tis impoſſible; can ever this muſterd-ſeed grow to that bigneſs, that the fowles of the aire ſhould there make their neſts? The Kingdom of Heaven is like Chriſt himſelf: Can this be the Meſſiah? 'tis the Carpenters ſon; can this Carpenters ſon be the Meſſiah? So the Kingdom of Heaven is like a grain of muſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erd-ſeed; comes with a ſmall motion: May be a Child makes a motion to his father, Oh! father, let there be pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yer in our family, Oh! let there be reading the Word in our family. May be the ſervant comes and makes a motion to the Miſtriſſe; Oh! Miſtriſſe, let's go to ſuch a Sermon, let us go to ſuch a meeting, let's go to prayer: The Kingdom of Heaven may come in ſuch a motion: by the hand of a Child, by the hand of a ſervant: take heed therefore if you have not ſubmitted to this offer; Oh! take heed, take heed how you neglect ſo great ſalvation: I ſay the Kingdom of heaven may come in ſuch a ſmall motion as you deſpiſe. And therefore, if ever the Lord breath upon any of your hearts; if the wind come about; man and woman, up with thy ſailes, now for thy life, now for thy Eternity; if this gale be loſt, may be thou ſhalt never have ſuch a gale again: The Kingdom of heaven does approach, and draw neer unto us, before we draw neer unto it: well therefore, when it comes, ſee that you accept of it.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words are part of that Sermon which <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt</hi> preached, when he firſt began for to preach the Goſpel. They contain, ye ſee, at the firſt view, An Exhortation to Repentance, with a motive, or encouragment thereunto: <hi>For the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take it for granted, that ye underſtand what is the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Repentance. And my deſign is not to fall into the common place of Repentance; but only to ſpeak to it ſo far as it hath relation to this motive.</p>
                  <p>Some there are that think theſe words are to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of a Legal Repentance; as if <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt's</hi> Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry were a legal Miniſtry; and in that ſenſe he himſelf a fore-runner to Jeſus Chriſt. This (me thinks) is to lowen the Miniſtry of <hi>John</hi> the Baptiſt. And if you look into the 1. Chap. of <hi>Luke,</hi> you will find, that <hi>John's</hi> Miniſtry was not a Legal Miniſtry, but a <hi>Goſpel-Miniſtry:</hi> (the 76, and the 77. verſes) <hi>Thou Child ſhalt be called the Prophet of the Higheſt: for thou ſhalt go before the face of the Lord, to prepare his wayes: To give knowledge of ſalvation unto his people, by the remiſſion of their ſins.</hi> And if ye look into the following
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:170112:120"/>verſe to the Text, ye ſhall finde the interpretation of this Repentance: <hi>Repent ye: for this is he that was ſpoken of by the Prophet</hi> Eſaias, <hi>ſaying, The voice of one crying in the wilderneſs, Prepare ye the way of the Lord, make his paths ſtraight.</hi> So that preparing the way of the Lord, and making his paths ſtraight; is all one with that which is going befoe. Now is any one able to make his paths ſtraight before he do come to Chriſt? why then do we come to Chriſt if we be able to make our paths ſtraight before we do come unto him?</p>
                  <p>And beſides, As the Motive is, ſuch is the Repentance that is founded on it. The motive here is <hi>Evangelical: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent ye: for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> The motive is <hi>Evangelical,</hi> ſurely therefore, the Repentance here requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, is not a <hi>Legal,</hi> but an <hi>Evangelical Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is it then? what is here meant by the Kingdom of Heaven? and the Kingdom of Heaven being at hand, or approaching?</p>
                  <p>In the language of the new Teſtament, the Kingdom of Heaven is ſometimes put for the Kingdom of Glory: Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it is put for the Church of Chriſt under the new Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament: Sometimes it is put for the Goſpel, and the prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching of the Goſpel: Sometimes for the whole Kingdom of Grace. I take it here for the whole ſtate of the Meſſiah: the Kingdom of grace, the preaching of the Goſpel, and the diſpenſations thereof. And he ſaies here, That the Kingdom of Heaven hath approach't: therefore do you turn, therefore do ye repent.</p>
                  <p>There are theſe Two Notes that lie before ye.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven does approach unto us, before we do come unto it. Repent ye: or turn ye: becauſe the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven hath approach't unto you;</hi> So in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, <hi>That the appropinquation, approaching, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing neer of the Kingdom of Heaven, is the higheſt, and the greateſt motive in the world unto true Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have ſpoken to the former in a Congregation not far
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:170112:120"/>diſtant: and my deſire is to ſpeak unto the Second.</p>
                  <p>The appropinquation, approaching, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Doct. </seg>
                     </label> or drawing neer of the Kingdom of Heaven, is the higheſt. and the greateſt motive in the world unto true Repentance.</p>
                  <p>This is the Motive that <hi>John</hi> uſes here; thus <hi>John</hi> begins, when he began for to preach the Goſpel. And if you look into the 4. the next Chapter, ye ſhall find, that our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt begins to preach Repentance upon the ſame Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: verſe the 17. from that time Jeſus began to preach, and ſay, <hi>Repent: for the Kingdome of Heaven is at hand.</hi> The ſame words. And if ye look into the 10. Chapter of <hi>Matthew,</hi> ye ſhall find, that when he ſent out his Apoſtles for to preach, he put the like words into their mouthes al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo: (at the 7. verſe) <hi>And as ye go, preach, ſaying, The Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There the word, Repent, is not you will ſay: But if you look into the 6. of <hi>Mark,</hi> and the 12. verſe: ye ſhall find that 'tis ſaid there, <hi>Then they went out, and preach't, that men ſhould repent.</hi> It was part of their Commiſſion: and thus they were to preach Repentance upon this motive, <hi>That the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand, or the Kingdom of heaven is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching.</hi> Surely therefore, this is the great Motive, the motive of motives. In the invitation to the great Supper ſpoken of in the Goſpel: what is the motive uſed, for to bring men unto the ſupper, but this? <hi>Come, for all things are now ready:</hi> Mercy is ready, the blood of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is ready, Come, for all things are now ready: this is the motive that is uſed there. And if ye look into the 12. Chapter of <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Romans,</hi> ye ſhall find at the 1. verſe, That when the Apoſtle doth exhort them, to preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God: he perſwades by this motive of mercy: <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſacrifice.</hi> I beſeech ye therefore. That Therefore, ſends us unto the former Chapter, to enquire what theſe mercies were. At the 30. verſe of the former Chapter, he ſaies unto them, <hi>For as ye in times paſt have not beleeved God,
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:170112:121"/>yet now have obtained mercy through their unbeliefe.</hi> The Jewes were caſt off: and the Gentiles (theſe Romans) received to mercy, the Kingdom of Heaven did come to them, the Goſpel effectually preach't to them, the Doctrine of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remiſſion of poor ſinners: Now (ſaies he) I beſeech you by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice. The Scripture is full of this.</p>
                  <p>But for our better opening, and clearing of this Truth: Let us I pray deſcend into the particulars of Repentance, and conſider how the grace, and mercy, and love of God in Chriſt (which is the ſubſtance of this Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven) hath an influence upon them all; and how all of them are cauſed thereby.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> A man that does Repent, muſt ſee, and know his ſins: true-ſight of ſin is requiſite to true Repentance Indeed, a man may in ſome meaſure attain unto the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and diſcovery of his ſin by ſome Affliction: when <hi>Adoni-bezek</hi> had his fingers, and toes cut off, you know what he ſaid: <hi>Thus have I done.</hi> Afflictions do un-leave a man, take off his leaves: when the leaves are off the hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, ye ſee thoſe birds-neſts, that ye could not ſee before when the leaves were on: And ſo, when affliction hath made one naked, and taken ones leaves off, a man is able to ſee thoſe neſts of corruption in his own heart that he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver did ſee before.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtle ſaies, <hi>By the Law is the knowledge of ſin:</hi> but now, though by the Law, as by a rule, we come to the knowledge of our ſin; and by Affliction we are help't to ſee the neſts of our own hearts: yet notwithſtanding, a man cannot ſee his ſins fully but by Goſpel-light; it is a work of the Spirit to convince of ſin: <hi>I will ſend the Spirit, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, and he ſhall convince the world of ſin.</hi> And where does the Spirit breath, but in the Goſpel, the Kingdom of Heaven, the preaching of the Goſpel? <hi>Received ye the Spirit</hi> (ſaies the Apoſtle) <hi>by the works of the Law, or by the preaching of faith?</hi> When once <hi>Eſay</hi> the Prophet had had a fight of Chriſt, he cries out, <hi>Vae mihi, I am undone: We is me, I am undone, I am unclean.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:170112:121"/>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> (for I will but touch upon theſe) As a man muſt know his ſin: So if he will repent truly, he muſt be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and humbled for it. If you look into the 7. of <hi>Luke,</hi> ye may ſee what work it had: A woman, a great ſinner comes to Chriſt, and ſhe waſhes his feet with her teares: what made her do ſo? She loved much, for much was forgiven her. So that the more the love and mercy of God in Chrſt is opened in the Goſpel, or does make it's approach unto a ſoul, the more the ſoul is ſet a weeping and mourning for ſin committed.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> As a man Repenting muſt be grieved for ſin com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; So he muſt, and he will loath himſelf: ſelf-loa-thing is requiſite to Repentance. If a man have taken a ſurfet by cating or drinking, he does not only loath the meat which cauſed the ſurfet, but he loaths the very Veſſel that hath the ſmell of the meat, or the liquor in it: So now, when a man comes to Repent, he does not only loath his ſin, but he loaths himſelfe, the veſſel, where the ſinne was: Oh! theſe filthy eyes of mine; Oh! theſe vile hands, Oh! this vile heart of mine; hee loaths him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. But what cauſes this ſelf-loathing? Th Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi> will tell ye, in the 20. of <hi>Ezekiel.</hi> the 41, 42, and 43. verſes: <hi>Then ſhall ye loath your ſelves when I am pacified;</hi> or when God had ſhown them mercy, cauſed his love to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach unto them: Then ſhould they loath themſelves. 'Tis not all your Afflictions: nor all my Threatnings (ſaies God) that will make ye to loath your ſelves: but when ye ſee my love, my grace, my pardoning mercy; then ſhall ye loath your ſelves: not your ſins only, but your ſelves alſo.</p>
                  <p>Again, A Repenting perſon does not only loath himſelf for his ſin: but he is aſhamed of it: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> he is aſhamed of his former evil waies. <hi>What fruit have ye of thoſe things whereof ye are [now] aſhamed:</hi> not before, but wereof ye are [now] aſhamed. So long as a man walks in the dark, he does not bluſh, he is not aſhamed though his Cloaths be ragged, and torne, and his naked fleſh appears, becauſe he is in the dark: But if he come to the light, then he bluſhes that his
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:170112:122"/>nakedneſs appears: And ſo long as men are in their ſins, and are in darkneſs, they are not aſhamed of their ſins; becauſe they are in darkneſs: But when once they come to the light, then they bluſh, and then they are aſhamed: What light is that that will aſhame one of ſin? there is light enough in hel-fire, for the damned there to reade their ſins by, but that don't make them aſhamed: where the light of the Goſpel, the opening of the Kingdom of Heaven is, and pardoning love is, there is ſhame. Ye ſhall ſee there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, how <hi>Ezra</hi> bulſhes, when he conſidered the love of God, and their ſins together: in the 9. of <hi>Ezra</hi> and the 6. verſe. <hi>And he ſaid, O my God, I am aſhamed and bluſh to lift up my face unto thee, my God:</hi> Why? <hi>for our iniquities are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed.</hi> Is that all? No, ſaies he at the 8. verſe: <hi>for a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſpace grace hath been ſhewed us from the Lord our God, to give us a remnant to eſeape, and to give us a nail in his Holy place: we were bond-men, yet our God hath not forſaken us in our bondage: And now, O our God, what ſhall we ſay after this?</hi> after this? The ſight of their own ſins, and the remembrance of Gods love together, made him bluſh. Ye know the place in <hi>Ezekiel, Then ſhall ye be confounded, and aſhamed, when I am pacified towards ye.</hi> The more a man knows that God is pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified towards him, the more he is aſhamed.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> A Repenting perſon is not only aſhamed of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer evil waies: but as occaſion ſerves, he will acknowledge his ſins: But I pray, what works the heart over to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment? When <hi>David</hi> had <hi>Saul</hi> at a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage, and ſpar'd him: <hi>Saul</hi> breaks forth into this expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>O my ſon</hi> David, <hi>thou art more righteous than I:</hi> O <hi>David!</hi> thou art a righteous man, but I am an unrighteous man. So when the ſoul ſees what infinite advantage the Lord hath it at, and how the Lord ſpareth; then the ſoul breaks forth, and ſaies, The Lord is righteous, I am unrighteous, I am unrighteous: this works an acknowledgment.</p>
                  <p>Sixtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> A Repenting perſon, does not only acknowledge his ſin as occaſion ſerves; but he labours to un-ſin his ſin; and truely, elſe it is no Repentance. He does walk contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:170112:122"/>unto himſelf, and his former ſelf: he does labour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do what he had done before ſinfully: he does labour to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay what he had ſaid before wickedly. Before the Jaylor was converted, he clap't up the Apoſtle into cloſe priſon, and either he whipt him there, or elſe being whipt, he did not relieve him, and waſh his wounds: But the Jaylor Repenting, mark how he walks contrary to himſelf: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting, he opens the priſon door, he waſhes the Apoſtles wounds, brings him into his own houſe, ſets meat before him. Thoſe Sorcerers <hi>Acts,</hi> 19. repenting, burnt their books, which before they prized, and ſtudies much. How did <hi>Manaſſes</hi> walk contrary to himſelf, when he once Repented?</p>
                  <p>Well, But what is that that will bring the ſoul to this diſpoſition, to walk contrary to ones former ſelf? If you look into the 116. <hi>Pſalm,</hi> ye ſhall find there how the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt eats up his former words: <hi>I ſaid in my haſt, all men are lyers:</hi> It was amiſs in me, I eat my words, I am ſorry for it: what made him do it? Saies he at the 3. verſe, <hi>The ſorrows of death compaſſed me about, and the pains of hell gate hold upon me: I found trouble and ſorrow: Then called I upon the Name of the Lord; O Lord I beſeech thee deliver me.</hi> (at the 5. verſe) <hi>Gracious is the Lord, and righteous: yea, our God is merciſul.</hi> Now having had a taſt of Gods grace, and God mercy, now he eats his former words. And ſo the good man <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zekiab: I ſaid</hi> (ſaies he) <hi>I am cut off from the land of the living:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.11.</note> He did eat his words, <hi>I repent, it was ſuddenly done:</hi> How was he wrought off to this? He had taſted of the love, and grace, and goodneſs of God; and this made him do it. So that now, look into the bowels of Repentance, and the ſeveral workings thereof, and ye ſhall find there is no ſuch way, or means, or motive to bring a ſoul unto Repentance, as the approaching of the Kingdom of Heaven, the word, and work of Gods grace, and love of God in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Would you know the Reaſon? Briefly thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Repentance is a fruit of faith.</hi> Ye have a notable expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:170112:123"/>of godly ſorrow to the height, in the 12. of <hi>Zachary,</hi> the latter end of the 10, 11, and 12. verſes, (ſpeaking of the Call and Converſion of the Jews.) <hi>They ſhall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only ſon: and ſhall be in bitterneſs for him,</hi> (the latter end of the 10. verſe) <hi>as one that is in bitterneſs for his firſt-born. Bitterneſs upon bitterneſs, and mourning. And in that day</hi> (at the 11. verſe) <hi>there ſhall be a great mourning in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giddon: And the land ſhall mourn, every family apart, the fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the houſe of</hi> David <hi>apart, and their wives apart.</hi> Here is great mourning, and ſorrow; What cauſed this? ſaies he at the 10. verſe, <hi>They ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn:</hi> They ſhall look upon me whom they have piercit. This is the eye of faith, and all true mour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and ſorrow does come from thence. All tears of Repentance flow from the eye of faith: the more a man by faith is able to ſee a pierced Chriſt, the more his heart is pierced for ſin committed: the more by faith a man is able to ſee a wounded Chriſt, the more will his heart be woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for ſin committed. Faith works Repentance: but what worketh faith? Surely the Goſpel, the preaching of the Goſpel: <hi>Received ye the Spirit by the works of the Law, or by the preaching of faith?</hi> He does not ſay by the preaching of the Goſpel, but by the preaching of faith: The Goſpel is called faith, not only becauſe 'tis the Cbject of faith; but that by which faith is wrought.</p>
                  <p>Again, As Repentance is a fruit of faith: So alſo it does flow from love. <hi>Amor doloris cauſa;</hi> Love is the cauſe of grief. The more a man loves another, or apprehends that he is loved of him; the more he grieves, if he hath any way injured him. If you at un-awares do ſtrike another, and one tell you that he is your enemy; ye grieve not, ye are not troubled; unleſs it be in regard of ſome miſchief that may come to your ſelf: But if one tell you, that he is a friend, a ſpecialfriend; that grieves you. So now if by my ſins I have ſtriken at God: if I look upon God as an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I am not grieved much, I am not troubled much:
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:170112:123"/>But when I conſider him as my father, the beſt friend I have in the world; and conſider how by my ſins I have ſtricken at him; this makes me grieve: Oh! that ever I ſhould wound the name of him whom my ſoul loves! <hi>She loved much</hi> (ſaies our Saviour concerning the weeping wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) ſhe loved much, for much was forgiven her: He does not ſay, ſhe wept much, for much was forgiven her: there was no mention before of her love, but only of her wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping; and yet ſaies our Saviour, ſhe loved much: becauſe he would ſhew what it was that drew up the ſluce of theſe tears: it was her love. And what cauſeth love? Love cauſeth love. The more a man ſees, and apprehends the love of Chriſt towards him, the more his heart is drawn out in love towards Chriſt again. And what greater act of love than this? That the Kingdom of Heaven approaches, that the Kingdom of Heaven ſhould come, and make it's approach to ſuch a poor ſinner as I am: Surely therefore, the approaching, or drawing neer of the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, is the higheſt, and greateſt motive in the world unto true Repentance.</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, Experience ſeems for to ſpeak the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: for, arguments drawn from Hell, and the wrath of God, ſeem to be more powerful, and efficacious in the working of Repentance. I have (will ſome ſay) ſometimes conſidered the wrath of God, and let out my heart upon arguments drawn from thence; and then I have bin much humbled, broken; been much affected: yea, the truth is, I have been more humbled, and more broken, and more affected, and more troubled for ſin; than when the Goſpel, the word of the Kingdom hath been preach'd, and opened unto me: How therefore is this true? Experience ſeems to ſpeak the contrary.</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, <hi>Quicquid recipitur &amp;c.</hi> Every thing is recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved according unto the receiver. A legal ſpirit doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh and ſavour moſt of thoſe arguments which are drawn from Hell, and from the wrath of God: But an Evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Chriſtian, thoſe that are drawn from love and mercy.
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:170112:124"/>But for the more full Anſwer to this, pray conſider with me, theſe Six, or Seven Diſtinctions.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> 
                     <hi>It's one thing for a man to be troubled in Conſcience: and another thing to be humbled for ſin committed.</hi> Thoſe that are Damn'd in Hell, and lie there deſpairing, muſt needs be troubled in Conſcience; how could they deſpaire elſe? Take a ſoul that hath the work of the Law upon him, and a meer work of the Law; and in ſome reſpects, he may be more troubled in Conſcience: but a Chriſtian that hath a work of the Goſpel upon his heart, is notwithſtanding this, more humbled for ſin committed.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> 
                     <hi>It's one thing for a man to be prick't in heart: and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother thing for a man to Repent.</hi> Ye ſhall find therefore, that in the 2. of the <hi>Acts:</hi> 'tis ſaid concerning divers, That they were prick't in their heart, and ſaid, <hi>What ſhall we do? Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> ſaid nnto them, <hi>Repent.</hi> They were prick't in their heart, and ſaid, what ſhall we do? and he ſaid, Repent. Poſſibly then, a man or woman may be prick't in the heart, and yet not Repent. Thoſe that have the work of the Law upon them, may have more legal prickings: but thoſe that have the work of the Goſpel, they Repent more.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> 
                     <hi>It's one thing for a man to Repent of ſin conſidered,</hi> in genere entis: <hi>and another thing,</hi> in genere moris. Sin may be conſidered in regard of the miſchief, and inconvenience that does come thereby: Or in regard of the moral evil of it. 'Tis ſaid concerning <hi>Judas,</hi> That when he ſaw what became of things, <hi>he Repented.</hi> And a Malefactor, a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, when he ſees what ſhall become of him, that he muſt die for his ſin; he may Repent of his ſin, <hi>in genere en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis;</hi> wiſhing that he had never done it: and yet my be not Repent, <hi>in genere moris.</hi> Ye reade concerning <hi>Eſau,</hi> in the 12. of the <hi>Hebrews, That he ſought his birth-right with teares;</hi> but found no room for his Repentance. He Repented, he Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented with Tears; but found no room for his Repentance. What Repentance was this? Saies <hi>Auſtin: He greived that he had loſt his birth-right; not that he had ſold his birth-right.</hi> So there was no room for ſuch a Repentance. And ſo now,
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:170112:124"/>take a man that hath the work of the Law upon his ſoul, and he may be much troubled, he may Repent, and he may have more Repentings in regard of the evil that does come by ſin: but the other more in regard of the evil that is in ſin it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the Fourth place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> 
                     <hi>It's one thing for a man to be broken with the weight of ſin: and another thing to have his ſoul thawen, and melted for it.</hi> There is a great deal of difference you know, between the breaking of the ice with your hands, or with a ſtaffe; and the thawing of the ice, melting by the thaw. When you take a ſtaffe and break the ice with your hands, though you break it in one place, it freezes in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: but when there is a thaw, then it melts, then it breaks every where. So now it is in regard of legal breakings: Here's a man hath a work of the Law upon his ſoul, he breaks for his Drunkenneſs, and he breaks for his Swearing, and he breaks for his Wantonneſs: Oh! but he freezes in Unbelief, in another place; he freezes in Unthankfulneſs: But when a goſpel-work comes, it makes a general thaw, a man is broken every where. And this is more.</p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>It is one thing for a man to have more ſorrow, griefe,</hi> 
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> 
                     <hi>Repentance in the Ore: and another thing to have a more ſorrow, griefe, and Repentance that is well Refin'd.</hi> As now, ſuppoſe a man take a hand full of gold in the Ore; it ſeems to be a great deal more than a twenty ſhilling-piece: I but, becauſe much of that is to be taken away, a great deal of Earth is to be taken away, it is leſs in the worth. Thus it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Legal Repentance, and Evangelical: The Legal Repentance may ſeem to be more in bulk: I but, a great deal of that is to be taken away: Much unbelief to be taken away: many ſad, deſpairing concluſions to be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: a great deal of Mercinarineſs to be taken away. And therefore ye ſhall obſerve, That when the father had kiſſ't the Prodigal, he left out the Mercinary piece that he ſpoke of before he came home. Saies he (at the 18. verſe) <hi>I will ariſe, and go to my father, and will ſay unto him, Father, I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and before thee, and am no more
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:170112:125"/>worthy to be called thy Son: make me as one of thy hired ſervants:</hi> (in the 15. Chapter, the 18. and 19. verſes) verſe the 20. He aroſe and came to his father: his father ſaw him, and ran and fell on his neck, and kiſſ't him, had compaſſion on him: ran, and fell on his neck, and kiſſ't him: And the ſon ſaid unto him, <hi>Father:</hi> (Now ſee whether he makes good his words, that he ſaid he would ſay when he came to his father) <hi>I have ſinned againſt Heaven, and in thy ſight, and am no more worthy to be called thy Son:</hi> But his Father ſaid to his ſervants, <hi>Bring forth the beſt robe:</hi> He leaves out that, Make me as one of thy hired ſervants. One kiſſe from his father had fyled off all the mercinary diſpoſition. Oh! much, much of the Legal-work is to be taken away: In Evangelical Repentance, there is much in little: in Legal Repentance there is little in much.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> 
                     <hi>It's one thing for grief, ſorrow, Repentance to be more in view, ſence, and noiſe: and another thing to be more in ſpirit, and in profit.</hi> As now for Example: The rain does ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time fall in a ſtorme, and when it does ſo, it makes a great noiſe: the earth hath not time for to take it at the firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it's boſome; it runs down the ſtreets in great abandance, and it ſtands in ſome places, in great plaſhes of water: At another time the rain fals by ſmal drops, and makes no ſuch noiſe; but yet notwithſtanding, it fals to the root of the Corn, and profits more: for when the rain fals ſo in a ſtorm, it laies the Corn; the Corn (I ſay) is laid by it. So now, ſorrow, and griefe ſometimes fals in a ſtorm, as in Legal Repentance; and it is great in view, ſtands in great plaſhes of water: Oh! but then it doth lay our Duties, it laies our Aſſurance, it laies our Faith: Evangelical Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, that makes no ſuch noiſe, but it fals to the root of the graces, and don't lay your comfort, it don't lay your Aſſurance, it don't lay your Duties. And ſo it is more in profit.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> This, <hi>Sorrow, grief, and Repentance; may take ones own heart much, or the heart of God much: ones own heart may be much affected, or the heart of God may be much affected:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved!
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:170112:125"/>we are apt to love our firſt-borne: and though Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal repentance does not alwaies go before the work of the Goſpel; (for what legal work was there in <hi>Matthew</hi> before he did come to Chriſt? or what Legal work was there in <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> before he came to Chriſt?) yet often times it does: I ſay yet often times it does: and this being the firſt-born of our ſoul, we go to God with both our Repentances Legal, and Evangelical: and we ſay, Lord, lay the hand, Oh! lay the right-hand of thy bleſſing upon my firſt born, oh! let that inherite: But the Lord deals here, as old <hi>Jacob</hi> did, when <hi>Joſeph</hi> brought his two Children before him to be bleſt: <hi>Jacob</hi> croſt his hands, and for <hi>Joſeph's</hi> ſake he laid the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing upon the younger. So now does God do; you would have me to lay my bleſſing (ſaies God) upon your firſt-born, upon your Elder, upon your Legal Repentance. No, ſaies God, I have ſaid, The Elder ſhal ſerve the Younger, &amp; I wil croſs my hands; and for <hi>Joſeph's</hi> ſake, becauſe there is more of Chriſt in this younger, therfore here will I lay the hand of my bleſſing. Beloved! the heart of a Chriſtian, a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious man, is never more drawn out in greif than upon the apprenſion of love in jured: The greater love, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter injury is preſented, the greater is the greif: When the Kingdom of Heaven comes unto a poor ſoul, there is the greateſt love preſented; ſin againſt that, is the greateſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury: when therefore a man is ſenfible of his ſin under that notion, then is his heart moſt affected and drawn forth in godly ſorrow. Surely therefore, The approaching, and the drawing neer of the Kingdom of Heaven, is the greateſt motive, &amp; argument under Heaven unto true Repentance.</p>

                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>2</label> why our hearts are no more broken, are no more humbled, no more Repentance, no more melting, heart no more ſoftened: becauſe ye don't labour to bring the Kingdom of Heaven neer unto your ſouls: I mean the Goſpel, and the Word of the Goſpel; free-remiſſion of poor ſinners: When the Kingdom of Heaven comes neer unto a perſon, he runs away from it, from the Promiſe; Oh! it belongs not to me; I am not ſo and ſo qualified: I am not ſo and ſo broken; I am not ſo and ſo weary, and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and therefore the promiſe belongs not to me. But the approaching of the Kingdom of Heaven, is the only means and motive to break thy heart, and wilt not thou therefore come to it, becauſe thy heart is not broken?</p>
                  <p>Oh! but the Promiſe don't belong to me: the Promiſe is made unto thoſe that are weary, and heavy laden, and I am not ſo.</p>
                  <p>Miſtake not good people, The invitation is made to the weary, and heavy laden, but the promiſe is made to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming. There are Two things in that ſpeech: <hi>Come unto me all ye that are weary, and heavy laden.</hi> Here's an Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and here's a Promiſe: The Invitation is made in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to thoſe that are weary, and heavy laden: Oh! but the Promiſe is made to Coming, the Promiſe is made to Comming.</p>
                  <pb n="253" facs="tcp:170112:126"/>
                  <p>But that is all one (you will ſay) for then it ſeems I am not invited, if the invitation be made to ſuch.</p>
                  <p>God does not ſpeak every thing, in every Scripture: But man or woman, art thou not invited by ſome other Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture? Pray what think ye of that in the 9. of the <hi>Proverbs: Wiſdom hath built her an houſe:</hi> (that is, Chriſt, compar'd with the former Chapter) <hi>ſhe hath kild her beaſts; ſhe hath mingled her wine; ſhe hath furniſht her table. She cries upon the high places of the City.</hi> What does ſhe cry? reade the 4. verſe: <hi>Who ſo is ſimple, let him come in hither: as for him that wanteth underſtanding,</hi> ye reade it: 'tis, <hi>As for him that wanteth heart, Come eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.</hi> The Invitation is made to ſimple ones: who ſo is ſimple, let him turn in hither.</p>
                  <p>Oh! But I have ſuch an heart as never any had: I want a heart unto all that is good. Mark, <hi>As for him that wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth heart,</hi> ſhe ſaith to him, <hi>Come, eat of my bread.</hi> How think ye? is the Invitation here made only to thoſe that are wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and heavy laden? And if ye conſider that place in the Goſpel which ye know. The Invitation to the great ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. The ſervants are ſent forth to call in thoſe that were bidden, and they excuſe themſelves: But they were bidden, they were invited: were they weary, and heavey laden think ye? Well, he ſends out again, and invites others. Look upon the text: were they weary, and heavy laden too? Go (ſaies he) Go, <hi>Go to the high-waies, and go to the hedges, and compel them to come in:</hi> were they weary, and heavy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den too? And if ye look into the 3. of the <hi>Revelations,</hi> ye find there, that our Saviour ſaies at the 20. verſe: <hi>Behold, I ſtand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen the door, I will come in, and ſup with him, and he with me.</hi> Our Saviour Chriſt here ſtands knocking, and offers the greateſt mercies that can be; fellowſhip, and communion with a poor ſoul: I will come in to him, and will ſup with him, and he with me. What greater bleſſing, or mercy can you deſire than fellowſhip with Jeſus Chriſt? Saies Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; If any man will open, I will come in, and ſup
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:170112:127"/>with him, and he with me. Here's mutual fellowſhip; Chriſt ſtands, and offers this, he ſtands knocking. But I pray, what door does he knock at? whoſe door does he knock at? Oh! my beloved, 'tis a <hi>Laodicean</hi> door: <hi>Laodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceans,</hi> what are thoſe? Luke-warm: I would thou wert hot, or cold; but ſeeing thou art Luke-warm, I will vomit thee out of my mouth. Luke-warm perſon worſe than prophane; and yet behold, Jeſus Chriſt ſtands at a luke-warm perſons door: knocking and tendering mercy to a luke-warme Laodicean perſon.</p>
                  <p>I but ſtay, May be they were weary, and heavy laden firſt, before they were invited.</p>
                  <p>Reade the 17. verſe. <hi>Becauſe thou ſaieſt, I am rich, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed with goods, and have need of nothing: and knoweſt not that thou art wrethed, and miſerable, and poor, and blind, and naked.</hi> Were theſe weary, and heavy laden, think ye? And yet at this door, behold! at this door the Lord Chriſt ſtands knocking! Oh! grace! Oh, glorious, rich grace! Oh! you that have ſtood at a diſtance from the promiſe, and dared not draw neer to the promiſe; ſaid it did not belong to you, you were not invited to mercy: Conſider, do you conſider what great enemies ye are unto your own breakings, and humblings that ye do ſo much deſire? The approaching of the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Doctrine of grace, and of free-remiſſion unto a poor ſinner, is the greateſt means, and motive in the world to break ones heart. Oh! therefore, as ever you deſire to have your hearts bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and to be humbled; look much to the Kingdom of Heaven, and the Doctrines thereof, and never ſay, it does not belong unto you.</p>
                  <p>But Thirdly, <label type="milestone">
                        <seg type="milestoneunit">Ʋſe. </seg>3</label> If theſe things be ſo? if there be a truth in this Doctrine? what infinite cauſe have we all, for to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, to mend our lives, and to turn to God? <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven hath approach't.</hi> Beloved! hath not the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven approach't unto our Nation? Take the Kingdom of Heaven for the Kingdom of Glory: and in theſe dying times, how hath the Kingdom of Heaven ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach't
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:170112:127"/>in that ſenſe! Take the Kingdom of Heaven for the State of the Church: and how many Church-truths hath broken out in theſe daies, that were not known be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Take the Kingdom of Heaven for the Goſpel; and the preaching of the Goſpel: how hath God gone up and down in theſe latter times, even in theſe times of trouble, preaching free-grace to poor England? Witneſs all theſe Victories ye have had, notwithſtanding all your ſins. Oh! England, England; now Repent, and turn unto the Lord: Surely, if ever, the Kingdom of Heaven is come to you: yea, hath not the Kingdom of Heaven approach't un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to many of your ſouls in particular? are there not ſome here, great ſinners, that have been invited to mercy? are there not ſome here, great ſinners, that have received mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? hath the Kingdom of Heaven approach't unto you? and will not you Repent? and will not you turn to God? and will not you amend your lives?</p>
                  <p>You will ſay, This work is not now to do: we have Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented already.</p>
                  <p>But pray give me leave: Have ye, have ye Repented up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Goſpel-Motives? have ye Repented upon this ground, becauſe the Kingdom of Heaven hath approach't? Oh! how many legal Profeſſors are there among Profeſſors? As there are Two ſorts of men in the world; Some that live in dark places, and priſons: And others that walk up and down in the light. So, ſome there are among Profeſſors, ſome legal, that woak up and down in the dark, and ſee no light: Others again, that walk up and down in the light of the Goſpel: many, many legal Profeſſors.</p>
                  <p>Beloved, The more Evangelical your Repentance is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> the more it will cure your ſouls, and not hurt your body: Legal Repentance ſoakes into the body, and frets out the very ſtrength of ones body. Pray look a little into the 33. Chapter of <hi>Job;</hi> See what the holy Ghoſt ſaies there. <hi>God ſpeaks once, yea twice, yet man percieves it not:</hi> (here is man in his natural, pure natural ſtate) <hi>In a dream</hi> (at the 15. verſe) <hi>in a viſion of the night; when deep ſleep falleth upon men, in ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brings
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:170112:128"/>upon the bed:</hi> (that is, before a man is aware.) <hi>Then he openeth the ears of men: and ſealeth their inſtruction: That he may withdraw man from his purpoſe, and hide pride from man.</hi> What then? <hi>He is chaſtened alſo with pain upon his bed, and the multitude of his bones with ſtrong pain: So that his life abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth bread, and his ſoul dainty meat.</hi> Verſe the 21. <hi>His fleſh is conſumed away, that it cannot be ſeen: and his bones that were not ſeen ſtick out: His ſoul draweth neer to the grave, and his life to the deſtroyers.</hi> Here's Legal work. Then comes the Goſpel. <hi>If there be a meſſenger with him, an Interpreter, one of a thouſand, to ſhow unto man his uprightneſs: Then he is gracious unto him, and ſaith, Deliver him from going down to the pit: I have found a ranſome.</hi> Then at the 25. verſe: <hi>His fleſh ſhall be freſher than a childs, he ſhall return to the daies of his youth.</hi> His fleſh ſhall be freſher than a childs. Thus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangelical Repentance is a friend both to ſoul and body: Meer Legal Repentance eats out the ſtrength of ones ſpirit, even of ones very body.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> The more Evangelical your Repentance is, the more you will be humbled, and grieved for ſins againſt the Goſpel. <hi>I will ſend</hi> (ſaies Chriſt) <hi>the Comforter, and he ſhall convince the world of ſin:</hi> what ſin? of ſin, and of unbeliefe. Oh! ſaies the ſoul that Repents Evangelically; who more guilty of unbelief than I? Oh! never any one more Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of Chriſt than I: Oh! the unkindneſs of my ſoul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Chriſt! Legal Repentance, it pitches upon ſome breach of the Law, and there it reſts.</p>
                  <p>Again, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Enangelical Repentance, complies with ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all joy, and is a friend unto it. You grieve for ſin, and you rejoyce in God: and when you rejoyce in God, you grieve for ſin. I will ſend the Comforter (ſaies our Saviour.) He does not ſay, I will ſend the Spirit: No, but I will ſend the Comforter, and he ſhall convince the world of ſin, and of unbelief. The Comforter, becauſe it ſhall be a work of Comfort, unto the ſoul that is convinced of ſin Goſpel-wiſe. and the more a man rejoyces in Chriſt, the more he grieves for ſin: and the more he grieves for ſin, the more he rejoyceth in Chriſt again.</p>
                  <pb n="257" facs="tcp:170112:128"/>
                  <p>Again, When your Repentance is Evangelical: <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> The more you apprehend, or hope that your ſin is pardoned, the more you wil grieve for it. Ye reade in the <hi>Pſalms</hi> of one ſpecial Penitential <hi>Pſalme</hi> of <hi>David:</hi> the 51. <hi>Pſalme.</hi> But when was that made? A <hi>Pſalme</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> when <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet came to him: that is, after the Prophet <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> had been with him. And what did <hi>Nathan</hi> the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſay to him? Saies <hi>Nathan, Thy ſin is forgiven thee.</hi> Upon that meſſage, <hi>David</hi> fals into a Penitential <hi>Pſalme,</hi> a <hi>Pſalme</hi> of Humiliation, and of Repentance. The more a man hath aſſurance that his ſin is pardoned, the more he doth grieve for it.</p>
                  <p>And the more Evangelical your Repentance is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="5"/> the more your heart will be inlarged to, and for Chriſt. The ſight of Gods free-love in Chriſt, will make your heart free in love unto Chriſt, and for Chriſt. When the poor ſinner, the woman, ſpoken of in the 7. of <hi>Luke,</hi> had much forgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven her freely; ſhe came and brought her precious boxes, and powred them out upon Jeſus Chriſt. So, when a ſoul hath taſted of the free love of God in Chriſt; then, no box<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of ointment too precious to powre out upon the feet of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Further, The more of the Goſpel, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> and the more of the Kingdom of Heaven, is in your Repentance: The more of the Goſpel will be in your Obedience, the more of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel will be in your Aſſurance, the more of the Goſpel will be in your Performance, in your prayers, and other duties. Beloved! Repentance is foundation work: it hath an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon all your ſervice. If your Repentance be Legal, your Obedience Legal, and your Performance Legal, and your Aſſurance Legal; ever tying God unto ſuch conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as he never tyed you to, through the improvement of your own unbelief. But now, when as your Repentance hath the Goſpel in it, drawn up, and raiſed upon ſuch mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives as theſe; then your Obedience, your Comforts, your Duties, your Aſſurance will have the impreſſion of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel alſo upon them.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:170112:129"/>
                  <p>And Seventhly, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="7"/> The more of the Goſpel, the Kingdom of Heaven, is in your Repentance: The more your hearts, and ſpirits will be meekned, and ſweetned towards the Saints, towards your fellow Servants the people of God. What is the Goſpel but a dead Chriſt? As Jeſus Chriſt was a living Goſpel: So the Goſpel is a dead Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>When the Goſpel approaches, when the kingdom of Heaven draws neer to a ſoul, and Chriſt therein; the heart is meekned, and made like to Chriſt. The Law is called a fiery Law, the Law of fire; Comapred unto <hi>Hagar;</hi> And ſaies the Apoſtle, The children of the bond-woman, will perſecute the children of the free-woman, of <hi>Sarah.</hi> And what's the reaſon that there is ſo much bitterneſs among Profeſſors? but becauſe there is no more of the Goſpel, and of the Kingdom of Heaven, in our Profeſſion. Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Lord: Ye ſee into what ſad times of Diſcord, and Bitterneſs we are now brought: As ever you do deſire to be free from this ſpirit of Bitterneſs: as ye do deſire that ye may not have a hand in oppoſing your fellow-ſervants, and acting a ſpirit of bitterneſs towards the Children of God: Oh! labour for more of the Goſpel, get more of it into your Repentance, and into your Obedience: Oh! let us labour to be more Evangelical than ever we have been.</p>
                  <p>I had need call upon my own heart for this: and give me leave to meaſure your own hearts by mine. Beloved! I don't now come to call for Repentance barely, but I come this night unto you, calling for refined Repentance, Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Repentance: theſe are refining times: your publick Worſhip refin'd, the Government refin'd: Chriſtians had need refine all their Duties, and all their Graces, and all their Comforts, and all their Aſſurance: we had need e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven take our whole garment; and look into every ſeame, bruſh every ſeame, there is ſo much duſt gotten into it. Oh! labour, labour to be more Evangelical, to get more of the Goſpel of Chriſt into all your Duties. The Goſpel is the Miniſtration of life: And the Miniſtration of the Law;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:170112:129"/>is called the Miniſtration of death. The Miniſtration of the Goſpel, called the Miniſtration of righteouſneſs: the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of the Law, is called the Miniſtration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. The Goſpel, is called a Glorious Goſpel, a Glorious Goſpel: as ye do deſire that Glory may be upon you, get more of this Glorious Goſpel into you: more of the Goſpel into all your Duties, into your Repentance: Which that you may do: Now even Repent, that ever you have been ſo Legal in your Repentance. A man will never be Evangelical in his Repentance, that does not in ſome meaſure, grieve that he hath been ſo Legal in his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p>And to end all: If at amy time, Man or Woman, thou doſt find thy heart dead, and dull, and ſaieſt thou canſt not pray, thou art unapt, and thy heart's hardened: Then go, go to the word of the Kingdom, go to the Goſpel, go, lay out thy ſoul before the word of the Goſpel: conſider the Kingdom of Heaven, the word of the Kingdom, free re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion unto poor ſinners; and this is the only way for to break your heart: for certainly, this is a truth that I have ſpread before you, (think of it:) The appropinquation, approaching, or drawing neer of the Kingdom of Heaven; is the higheſt, and the greateſt motive in the world unto true Repentance.</p>
